# NLP for Conflict Analysis

This project explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly TF-IDF and BERT, to analyze and understand YouTube comments related to the Gaza-Israel conflict. The goal is to gain insights from large volumes of user-generated content on social media platforms and apply NLP methods to uncover patterns, sentiments, and significant discussions surrounding the topic.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imane-go/nlp-for-conflict-analysis.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
cd nlp-for-conflict-analysis
4. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
5. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


You may need to create a requirements.txt file with the necessary packages (e.g., pandas, numpy, sklearn, tensorflow, etc.).

## Data
You can download the raw data (e.g., YouTube comments) and place them in the data/raw/ folder. The data preprocessing script will clean and prepare the data for further analysis.

## Running the Analysis
Start by exploring the data in the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ folder.

Use the Python scripts in the src/ folder to preprocess the data and apply TF-IDF vectorization.

For BERT-based analysis, you can modify the bert_analysis.py script.

## Usage
Data Preprocessing: The script data_preprocessing.py will clean and prepare the raw data for analysis.

TF-IDF Analysis: tfidf_analysis.py handles TF-IDF vectorization and analyzing the most important terms.

BERT Analysis: BERT-based analysis will be added later. This section will leverage pre-trained models for sentiment analysis and other NLP tasks.
