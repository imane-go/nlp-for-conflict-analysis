# NLP for Conflict Analysis

This project explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly TF-IDF and BERT, to analyze and understand YouTube comments related to the Gaza-Israel conflict. The goal is to gain insights from large volumes of user-generated content on social media platforms and apply NLP methods to uncover patterns, sentiments, and significant discussions surrounding the topic.
