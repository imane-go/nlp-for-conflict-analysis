" Thanks for posting, !"
" Crazy part is this same video is posted in the combat footage sub but says that was hamas who was shooting, and anyone who says otherwise gets down voted to hell lmao hasbara bots aren't even trying anymore they just change video titles and run with it"
" dude combat footage is the most pos-scum sub out there, it's impossible to speak facts there without getting downvoted by a bunch of bloodthirsty armchair generals."
 That's because it's full of people who probably masturbate to snuff films
" ""Probably"" is an understatement, the posts on there that typically perform the best are the ones where someone got killed in the most horrific ways."
" Yeah it's like cancer at this point lol. Combat footage, worldnews are the worst."
" True, I got banned from worldnews lol, those Hasbara rats are everywhere"
" It's crazy, like they're trying to beat the narrative before it's a known fact it was the IDF, they try to flood social media with false titles to sway public opinion. Then turn around and call anything from the Palestinian side propaganda lmao"
 It‚Äôs so tiring and heartbreaking
 I agree. I just up vote or down vote at this point since I'm blocked from most of the big subs lol. Trying to do my part
 On this new account I‚Äôm only banned from politics
 Give it time lmao it seems like most big subs are run by hasbara. Literally saying the word hasbara got me banned from worldnews its honestly a joke at this point
 Explaining the roots of from the river to the sea is what got me banned from politics
 They can keep trying to silence us. The truth will come out eventually! ‚úåüèæ
 The innocent always seem to carry the heaviest burden.
" I have to give it a lot of credit to the young men who dig through the destruction and seek for people. It is unfortunate that this place in Gaza had to come to this. Wars are brutal, especially for civilians who think and hope to avoid but regardless they are the first to suffer in it."
" it's so heartbreaking to watch,the father who's looking for his four children and that kid saying we didn't do anything, just bring tears toy eyes and so much pain I pray that this will end soon"
 It is really sad and so heartbreaking to see people suffering this way. May the peace happen so that these lives will be preserved
" RIP for all Innocent,   It is really sad and so heartbreaking to see people suffering this way. May the peace happen so that these lives will be preserved."

" my heart bleeds for the children of both Israel and Palestine,  war is so very nasty and just because of some terrorist."
 It is really sad and so heartbreaking to see people suffering this way. May the peace happen so that these lives will be preserved.
" Vibrations of peace, love and happiness to all souls in and affected by the war. May this conflict soon be over and people healed."
 The guy looking for his 4 kids under the ruble has me in tears as I look at my son. I can hardly deal with my pain of thinking what if. I can‚Äôt even imagine what this man is feeling. How can God let this happen why is this world so cruel. Why are we here.
 Honestly this is so heartbreaking
" So heartbreaking, I pray for peace"
 Heart wrenching moment
 So sad to see the people got suffering like this
" To have a peaceful country is really a blessing, May they find peace and forgive each others to save  lives"
 Rip to all the innocent lives lost.
" ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt do anything wrong‚Äù, no young children cannot. But when a civilization has so much hate in its heart, it does do something wrong. When it believes that the others are evil, and killing them is a moral obligation of divine righteousness, that is something wrong. Hopefully the hurt children of Gaza have the clarity to understand cause and effect, rather than fall into the same self-destructive pit of blind hatred and misguided revenge like their parents are writhing in now."
 Heartbreaking
 Hamas has no remorse for their brutalities exhibited on Oct 7 attack‚Ä¶ just remember they still held so many hostages‚Ä¶. Obviously not for the benefit of ordinary people of Gaza but for their leverage‚Ä¶. So sickening‚Ä¶.
" Nobody win in any war sad to say. Prayers for peace in Jerusalem, Israel and the whole world. It's an old issue since time immemorial during old testament times, Israel and Palestine fought for territory."

" Your reporting is objective, factual, real depictions of the war toll on the Gazans.   I do hope you continue to report as objectively, not cynically or less than factual, about the IDF as well.   To lose sight of who Hamas really is, and also who elected them to power - pushing aside Fatah - in 2007,  well then you would be one-sided wouldn't you?   And this would push your fairness and good judgment into question.... again... wouldn't it?"
 Very heartbreaking to see..
" After a month, the BBC is now covering the topic of civilian casualties. It seems they are interested in maintaining a favorable reputation among the Muslim audience"

" Why their muslim brothers from another countries are not letting Gaza refugees in if they care about Palestinians so much? Look what Europe did to the Ukrainian refugees when they needed help most! We sheltered them! Why the Muslim would is so hypocritical?! Having demonstrations with Palestinian flags is yes, but helping these people by allowing them to enter your country in safety - no, thank you! You need them as a human shield in your fight with Israel. If this is the case, I would say: Go Israel!"

 During the end of WW2 Russia and the Allies did not have to bomb Germany because inside with the german army there were also civilians.
 Let peace reign please.
 This is the real news but sadly mainstream media won't show this
 Its really unfortunate a disgrace that Gazanian choose a terrorist leader.. my heart goes to the innocent children..because in my heart i know only toddlers dont know what happen inside GAZA during thier unwar days.. Many civilian understand the activity of HAMAS inside GAZA
 Praying for peace
" So many children are killed and wounded, but the world is not responding. This is the height of cruelty. Very painful."
 Ohhh lord please help and protect the innocent please lord
 Imagine you are walking down the street and two people are arguing.
 This hurts alot
 Who is using who as human shields? Why are the vast majority of Palestinians not allowed to leave Gaza?
 Sadness of epic proportions
 that man trying to dig his family members out. imagine how painful that would be. imagine how tired he would be. imagine if you were him.

" That little boy ""We didn't do anything wrong!"" is heartbreaking - but not as heartbreaking as a baby baked in an oven by Hamas in a kibbutz.  Tell him, don't hide the truth."

" Thank you very much to Kim Jong Un, you and Putin Pyongyang are the best leaders in the world. They have no policy. It is forbidden to call them leaders. No crooked person can be a leader. There is no doubt that such crooked people will be judged in this world and in the hereafter"
 This is just too much depression and sad :((((((((((((((((((((((

 those calling for a ceasefire don't seem to realize that there was one on the morning of October 7th.
" Hamas leader said two days ago that a 2nd, 3rd, 4th October 7th is planned."
 Israel has every right to defend it's people as well as the right to defend themselves
" Just consider this, The present Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that the greatest single mistake of the Palestinian Arab delegates was to refuse the offer of an independent State which was offered to them in 1947 by the UN, this newly formed State would have been in areas of old Palestine that are now referred to as the disputed territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip In the Camp David agreements (in the 1970s)held in the USA, Israel offered the Palestinians a State in these disputed territories. Again in the Oslo accords (in around 1993) the Palestinians were offered an independent state in the disputed territories. Many times over the Israeli Government has offered the Palestinian representatives an Independent State"

 Can someone clarify why foreign passports are given the green light through the gates and others don't? Is Egypt being paid for this? I am sure there is an explanation to this why the discrimit actions are being exercised to separate who goes through those gates. This should be what needs to be made public.

 It‚Äôs just awful that HAMAS has subjected its own people to this. They should put on uniforms and fight like real soldiers on the battlefield instead of hiding behind women and children. But I guess that‚Äôs what terrorists do?  A little curious about why the BBC said nothing about all of the Israeli victims that were brutally murdered?
 The little boy saying we didn't do anything wrong sounds like a rehearsed response. It is not the average response of a innocent child. I would expect a question along the lines of why did this happen not the polarised Us vs Them we are innocent.
 It must be understood that Hamas strategically built their tunnels under their own civilians. They alone are responsible for all the civilian casualties.
 Because of arrogant of people falled to make peace with other people ennosent people died
 How about more reports on those effected by the hostages taken by Hamas?
 You can't avoid the sacrifice of life just to seek peace.

" Many people mistakenly understand that Palestine is just Hamas, and Hamas seems to represent everything Palestine.  Not so... Palestine still has organizations called Fatah and PLO, not just Hamas.  The difference is that Fatah/PLO agrees with the establishment of two states (Israel & Palestine), while Hamas is an organization that opposes this and wants to eliminate the state of Israel, thereby carrying out terror.  That is why Hamas is called a terrorist by several countries."

" How long will it take until those Western planes arrive in Ukraine promised in September at the latest? And how long does pilot training last? They're just not those UFOs, they still have a handle, clutch, etc. :)), just a little more sophisticated! These had to be given since the beginning of the invasion, as well as the long-range weapons, not only up to 80 km, and the Russians were shooting wildly from hundreds of km from the Black Sea, more into civilian homes! The faces did not want to escalate, but they did this every day! What I didn't understand... why after the annexation of Crimea in 2014 like that, without a single shot, why didn't Ukraine arm itself to the teeth, with their immense wealth? They had plenty of time until 2022 to do everything they could to not join those Westerners who give them weapons anyway always late and always weaker than the Russians. Later, those Himars systems came after they had already destroyed many cities in Ukraine! By the way, what is the ratio of destruction in Ukraine compared to Russia? I don't think it's even 1 to 10! Well, why are there no destructions on the territory of the Russians, I repeat, at least 10% compared to Ukraine?? There are still some dubious things like that, I don't understand what kind of war this is, you are allowed to shoot from hundreds of km and I am not, only a maximum of 80 km! Why don't the Ukrainians rumble the Russians like Israel is doing now in Gaza for much less (well, as facts are facts, just as odious, I was referring to the difference between the number of victims) Why didn't they also give the Ukrainians at the beginning the famous Iron Dum defense systems?? Not to upset the Russians? No, now they have also seen what it means to be bombed... That's why the bear has no tail!"

" Once Hamas surrenders, this will all be over. Israel does not seek war, but must defend itself against evil. It is heartbreaking that Palestinians are pawns in this game for Hamas and Iran."

 Gaza City isn't the headquarters of Hamas. Hamas operates out of Qatar. Why have the IDF not gone for the jugular? I suspect that Netenyahu relies upon the threat of Hamas for his political survival. Israel relies upon the goodwill of the West... most analysts see very little sense in a ground offensive in Gaza.

" In the Holy Quran, Allah (Ellah), (the One Lord and Only one God), stated that if the Israelites create Injustice and Chaos, that is, if they break their promises, the promise given to them will be broken. God knows the beginning of this event is the Gaza war, the institutional murder and genocide of Palestinians. (Palestanian Holocaust) This event will place in the hearts of the Far Eastern nations the idea that other nations will also be victorious against the Israelites. Allah in the Quran; He initially gives them good news and then threatens them on the condition of justice and not causing chaos. No sane religious Jew should follow or support the Zionists. They should help protect the Palestinians in their own favor."

 Heart broke this is the Genocides! Wars
 The hamas n Isreal war must be stopped and both parties must sit together and propose a peace resolution . That hear after no body should attack infuture. Both gaza n Isreal must develop friendly relations as usual. And maintain brotherly hood for ever. This will be an eye opening for both because both had lost their innocent people and and officials. War is not at all a solution for every issue between any two nations these days . Every religios people will enjoy freedom peace n love in this world then only this world will be saved fromm natuaral calamities by mutual cooperation among world countries. For example any astoroids if going to strike are any corona like virus attacks then every one fears and collectively try to escape from the death of door irrespective of all religions. So try for world hormany all of us This is not the time for wars but for only save people and save the people.

 My question is who was policing Gaza during the Hamas buildup and why they never noticed anything.
" Despite all this, Hamas has no intention of releasing the prisoners"

The big difference between Israel and Hamas is Israel uses soldiers to protect civilians, Hamas use civilians to protect soldiers.

 It's so sad this all heartbreaking things. The Jews don't care about any Arab or African life. The people of Palestine should understand that Hamas is using them as human shield. Also it's a stupidity to me to throw rocks to an armed Israeli officer who don't care about your life. So sad to see kids and civilians suffering like this. For ones stronger than you bowing diplomacy is much better or go and fight in the desert or bush not in the middle of civilians. My apology if I hurt any with this comment. It's my true opinion from my little understanding
" They should have opened Rafa border for them weeks ago . Don't blame Israel,  they are fighting Hamas not inocent people of Gaza . UN should have helped with civilians being taken to Egipt . Don't blame Israelis they're fighting  Hamas."
 It is not Israel Air strike. It is US UK and  EU Air Strike

 There is truly need for a cease fire those kids crying saying we didn't do nothing need to be considered. This is very sad to watch

 Human have long way to go
" Its sad to see a civilians killed in the war. But palestinian was given a chance to evacuate to south. But they remained stood with hamas. As you see almost all civilians present are men. And when someone was killed or wounded they displayed when cameras are around. Yes they are civilians but in war, civilians are the most affected. I think news from journalists give more reports give more hate to people around the world."
" HAMAS played fuck around and find out, and they found out pretty quickly!"
 Is Gaza City surrounded? Really!!! Let me check with the other respectable Channels if this is true!
 Civilians were advised to leave 2 weeks ago and daily since
 Let's see. Israel has told them and told them to get out of the City and they still stay. Either they are willing shields or simply too apathetic to move. It's not a war crime when you give them time to move and they don't move. Israel has done what it can. The rest falls on the Palestinians.

 That should be no ceasefire they never asked for this war but they will finish it
 its sad how civillians get caught up in this but so simple. Dont harbour terrorists!
 the world is becoming more evil than we ever Blvd
 Holy land says eye for an eye .... but poor innocent Gaza kids
 Gaza invaded israel and started the war.. This would be like saying germany is the victim after invading russia
 A normal life in Gaza is not possible when Hamas mobilized 25000 terrorists and an underground tunnel filled with rockets. How hard is to get yourself to the south. Use you logic.

But since the USA and other European countries are saying that they have the right to defend themselves it is so, well, because an occupier understands the mind set of another occupier since the USA itself was build on the genocides and slaughtering and killing of the native people of the land. So it became a habit to kill people and take their lands. Even they are the last ones to talk about terrorism, I mean their history is quite an interesting history when it comes to genocides and killing of people,same for the UK and same for France and for Israel and on and on. They created the term ""terrorism ""and they use it upon whoever they want (whether they are bad or good) to serve their intrests, but they never apply it upon themselves. Well, there terrorist behaviours did not remain just in history if we look at Gaza now as the simplest example."
 An occupied position is already an aggressive offense.
 Human rights can be understood as defining those basic standards which are necessary for a life of dignity
 They are always defending and always end up gaining territory.
" If you occupy someone's home, you have no right to self defence. You are the aggressor not the victim."
" ''My name is Dr. Reuvan Moscovitz and I'am a Holocaust survivor that cannot live with the fact that the state of Israel is imprisoning an entire people behind fences. It's just immoral. What happened to me in the Holocaust wakes me up every night, and I hope we don't do the same thing to our neighbors. I compare what happened to me in the Holocaust to what the besieged Palestinian children are going through.''"
 ''There cannot be PEACE in the Middle East without giving Palestinians their full right.''
" It's like the spoiled kid kicking the hornets nest when no one is looking, then crying victim when they get stung and claiming they didn't start it."
 ''Israelis would mostly breathe a sigh of relief if Palestinians were to somehow d i s a p p e a r.''
 Israel claim to self defense should have been questioned right from the beginning!
" If what Israel is doing is called self defense, then what Russia is doing to Ukraine is also self defense"
 Invader does not have any right to self defence

" I gave up talking to my Jewish friends that are grandparents. They can't make the cognitive connection with this conflict without ""choosing"" to support Israel's right to self defense, and blame of Hamas, no matter what happens."
 A  moral paradox and dilemma has existed for Israelis and Palestinians ever since Hamas has been in power in Gaza.  This paradox and dilemma could be understood with this analogy.
" An occupying power has no right to defend itself according to international law, common sense and sheer logic."
" ‚ÄúThe view of Jerusalem is the history of the world; it is more, it is the history of earth and of heaven.‚Äù ‚ÄìBenjamin Disraeli"
 This is the crime of the century!!!

" ''In my opinion, Israel has the right to its security as much as the Palestinians have the right to resist occupation. Israel has the power in this perpetual stalemate, as it also has the power to break it and begin a meaningful PEACE process.''"

" Palestinians in Gaza are indeed occupied‚Äîby Hamas. Once Hamas seized full control of Gaza they used external economic aid to wage war on Israel by building rockets and a vast tunnel network rather than improve the lives of its people. Palestinians in Gaza may be taught to hate Israel, but that anger is misplaced by the real occupiers."
 They have been saying self defense for years as they occupy others land and put them in prison if they protest.

" What do they mean by self defence? Does their self defence mean sacrificing their own people who are Hamas hostages? At this point, pro israeli who want genocide to continue have decided to offer their family members to Hamas happily for their stolen state."
 The Oc'cupier has no right to defend him self but the Oc'ccupied  has.
" Quote ""Ultimately though, no matter what happens in Gaza two people will still have to share the land between Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. Neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis are leaving. "" Unqote"
 Obviously Israel has rights of self-defence. It's 100% agreed. But not from children. Killing children it's look like abnormality!!! If they want then they can save lives of children easily.They could use technology for saving lives of children. It's not so much difficult for them. because they are the most educated nation have good knowledge about technology of this world & they can use technology very well that's other nation can't do.

 I do not understand why the UN limits itself to holding meetings and passing resolutions on paper that have not been fulfilled by Israel for the last 40 years
 As long as some countries have veto power there is no point of having a security council. They can have sessions after sessions till the end of time but nothing will come out of it.
 They should make a resolution to desolve veto powers.
 Take away veto rights wtf...Why should any country have veto rights..whats the purpose of voting on a resolution?????

" Palestine situation is a test for international community, if we fail, forget about any peace or justice across the globe."
" There shouldn‚Äôt be any veto power, all member states should have one vote equally and fairly."
 The UN couldn't  stop a fly. They have a dismal history  of making just about every conflict worse. In Angola they prevented the citizens  from defending  themselves and when the Communists came in instead of fighting them they evacuated with the guns they confiscated  from the citizens. So the resulting  slaughter was brutal. This has happened  over and over and over.
" How is it that common people (those leaving comments here) see so clearly that the UN and the Security Council are so pass√© but the so called heads of countries do not? The main culprits making these organizations so impotent are the US, UK, France and the like."
 What is UN Security Council? Its American past time game
 To my sight... with what is going on with the Palestinians.. it's reminding me of what happened in Uganda. Many blessings for a more peaceful and compassionate world.
 Security council is spineless
" OMG! All the patients in the ICU ward at al-Shifa have died due to lack of fuel, electricity & medical supplies! More patients are expected to die!"
 I also think we cannot really count on UN to solve the problem of Palestine but a miracle is need. May Allah procted us all as we live in very challenging times
" If so, why don't UN arrest Netanyahu for international criminal regardless of US? I'm getting doubtful of the purpose of UN."
 SHAME ON SECURITY COUNCIL
" I believe the UN security council should resign, be dismantled and a new global security system must be created with fundamental principles based on social justice, protection of human rights and ensuring that all lives matter. The question is how can we initiate a petition calling for the dismantling of the UN security council?"
 Firm security is exclusively 'members only'.
 Un countries that voted against  ceasefire should be ashamed
 The answer is no. The UNSC can not because the US will vetoed as it has been doing already.
 How do these world leaders with the power to stop this madness look their children and grandchildren in the eye knowing their inaction has made the world a much more dangerous place for all.
 I don‚Äôt understand why security council even exists if they have no power at all.

" The security council has lost all credibility, it had no credibility for a long time. if Vito power stays in place."
 Can any African leader do the same and be not charge or indictment waah this world is full of hypocrisy
 Condemnation is about as much use as an ash tray on a motorbike. The UN is much like a chocolate teapot.
" I compare this situation like a child, who no matter what they do they never face consequences.  Maybe a slap on the wrist here and there but never punishment that equals the wrong. That child is now self entitled,  feels like they can do whatever they want,  and no matter the situation,  you must acknowledge they are the victim. The child is spoiled,  disrespectful to the parents and anyone who disagrees with them. And of course that child could care less what you say at this point. Even when you try to chastize or provide correction, it doesn't matter. Its going to take more than a long overdue letter, ""asking"" for pauses to get this rotten child's attention."
 Why are these people not calling out the USA and Uk. They are complict with this carnage and should be shunned by the world.
 Keep up the great panel discussions Al Jazeera
 You do know that an Israeli soldier threw a ganade into their mosque
 Shame to UNSC
 Why don't anyone not speak about hostages and their wellbeing? Specially about children and elderly
 Has the security council ever done anything?
" The last speaker explained it perfectly: the boss of the UN did speak out about Gaza, while he remained largely silent on other occasions. This clearly shows that it's all about Israel, not about the extent of the facts on the ground: no problem about Yemen, about the Uigurs, about the Rohynia, about Sudan, about Ethiopia (the example given by the speaker), about Syria, about Congo. He is concerned and upset only when Israel can be blamed."
 When has anyone taken international law seriously. They serve no purpose.
 Netanyahu has no respect for anyone nor anything!
" People of the honest and caring Palestinians please do not stop supporting and demonstrating all over the world, we should continue and support until they give two state solutions ."
 This reminds me of the League of Nations prior to 1939. Solidarity does very little to protect the weak and vulnerable

 Natanyau is writing a new chapter of history that will never be forgotten forever.
 It's almost like there's a small group of people who really do control everything.
 Imagine how much these people are paid to achieve nothing.
 The UN from the start should have asked Israel to take the civilians into Israel. the UN should have passed a resolution that says Israel should take all the children to Israel the UN will provide the food and everything inside Israel. if Israel refused the hypocrites would have no choice or excuse but to force them to take them
 UN is just an empty shell.
 I wonder how do these leaders sleep at night
" In this discussion, none of these speakers have mentioned or condemned Hamas. They point out the situation as continuation of Israeli occupation 15 or 16 years back.. The discussion of the 7th of October raid by Hamas into Israel which instigated the whole Israeli decimation of Gaza is being left out."
" The security council lost credibility when Putin‚Äôs war on Ukraine ramped up in 2022, and Russia vetoed the resolution condemning the aggression."
 its almost as though international law is a joke? who could have known?
 UN resolutions are like admiring a Man who' loves another woman
 Security council don‚Äôt humiliate yourself anymore.
" Article 11 UN resolution 194, the Palestinians have the right to return home is affirmed again and again and again."
" The a law is only valid when it is enforced, which relies on the use of force, no one can enforce any resolution or law without it when there‚Äôs no consequences for breaking them. In this case, Israel is not following UN laws and resolutions. To enforce or punish includes confronting Israelis who would push back, not all of them, but some, and there are some who would rather die than give in, so there‚Äôs no choice than to use force including killing Jews. That has so much baggage in the west that governments can‚Äôt even lay a hand on Israel with force without being accused of restarting the holocaust. There are many people in every country that do crime from all identities to including Jews, when concluded by a fair trial and representation and it has gone through a rigorous legal process, punishment is prescribed. Not on innocent people, people who specifically with evidence have done something wrong. This is done for crimes by any identity in all countries, and at best they all aspire to treat all crimes fairly and identities fairly. I‚Äôm pretty sure there have been Jews as well as Asians, Arabs, Germans, Englishman who all have to face some punishment and the law works when they do what they say. If a Jewish person, Arab person, Asian etc person does a crime, let‚Äôs say New York, the law would make no hesitation to put any of them in jail or proscribe punishment like a fine or community service when a clear legal process with ample evidence justifies it. International law has to do the same"
 UNO is himself a part of this brutality against humanity.
 Yah Allah please help Palestine.
" Watching this genocide unfold, and the Palestinian people pull one another from the rubble of bombed buildings, shows how strong and resilient they are as a people, and this disgusting zionist treatment has been going on for generations of Palestinians. Their resilience, and calmness while death, and destruction surrounds them is unbelievable. A beautiful and strong Nation. If only the rest of the World would stand up to the zionists. Thank you to the people of Palestine for your sacrifice."
 Lord show mercy and take care of this

 We have to dissolve the UN security council as it's toothless.

" In the world today, war is meaningless and is a definite waste of energy and human resources. Please abolish war at the global level"
 It‚Äôs time for peacekeepers to move in.
" Hey Google why don‚Äôt channels like Fox News, NBC and so on have a community or Wiki note about who funds them (both State and corporate interests) attached to their content?  Are the lists too long for Western news outlets, because that would only announce the urgency of such measures surely?  Seems to me all news services should have to be transparent about who is funding them so that viewers be made aware of any possible bias and conflicts of interest in their content and that you guys are in a unique position to do this.  This would‚Äôve been especially useful during Covid, for example.  Why is it only an Arab broadcaster in which this is deemed vital information for your viewers to be made aware of?"
 Should security council voted to ban Alzajeera then it is god willingly trusted!
 The UN will only take immediate action if Israel is at the brink of defeat. It has happened before in Bosnia.
" GOD is allowing this system to go on under the rule of mankind for a little while longer, to prove that man cannot rule over himself, thus proving the right for GOD to rule over mankind!"
 We are witnessing a spoiled child ignoring the rules because it knows there are no consequences.
 Security council...what a waste funding them...people voice just threw into dustbin by them.
 Moloch reigns from Israel using logical fallacies to build a sheild of protection. Its enblazened emblem is the star of Remphan

 I try to listen to both sides.
 Sad
 . believe that this carnage is allowed to happen when we have agenies like the UN and the ICC in the world
 The world should support Israel. They are doing the tough job for the entire world. Most Leaders of the world know this but cannot say it publicly. They want to be politically correct
" Exactly, it's a mockery of international law."
 i don't understand~i understood that they were going to implement a cease fire asap but that it may take more time~
 Sham on you security council
 Shame on UN
 This is injustice to allow veto power to  five UNO Security Council's members which reject majority votes. What is the purpose of the Security Council and the UNO? What is all about this drama? Better shut down Security Council and the UNO forever.
" Back in the 1940s, when they wanted to swindle the Palestinians, the USA, Britain, France and rest of the Colonial Club was able to pass the resolution very quickly."
" No, have they stopped a war anywhere?"

 How helpless this UN security counsil is just got to know. So many Talks n Meetings but no action against israel. UN is looking like a handicapped person who just see and speak little but unable to do anything. It would have been better UN should not exist. What a shame.

 No they cant they have not done nothing in the whole month
" Hamas has a non-stop supply of weapons, but no aid for the people that they're fighting for?  What about them? What are they eating? How are they managing so well?"
" Remember my brother UN only listen to those who looks like them and Gazian dont looks like those who denial Gazian right to exist. American governments have know regard for Gazians life bcs of the colour of their skin and eyes. American government has disappointed a lot of people, but coloured people knows that injustice are often in the world when its comes to Nationality."
 Useless Organization
 What's the use of the U.N. if anyone country or in this case Netanyahu has the powers to not to comply.... WHAT IF OTHERS COUNTRY TAKES THIS SAME POSITION??
 No and Arab states have not voiced enough opposition taken action either.
 So how can we stop this ?‚Ä¶ who can ? If United Nations Can‚Äôt ?
 Why would they want to stop?
 Didn't the UN deploy troops during the Yugoslav Wars?
" I don't see how feeding one side with weapons and ammunition and the other side with water and bandages helps - What kind of sick joke is that? When words can justify the killing of over 4500 children, maybe it is time to stop talking and take tangible actions."
 Why have Veto rights if all countries are equal in UN ?

 Israel will do whatever they will as they did the last years! The vetos are just for the press in the end. Israel should wake up and realise the 2 states solution and not occupate place over place in Palestine. U have your place give them theyr place. Simple as that!!

 The leaders of the whole world work so slowly and Israel works so fast. They were talking about the word leader on you even a month ago and are still talking about the same.
 Security Council is spineless. No proper representation
 What is the UN for?
 What can UN do with with conceptual framed attack' ?
 As Gadafi said - all they do is talk and nothing changes
 UN was made to recognize Israel.
 Credibilty of the Secuirty Council is incredibly useless I had ears prior think not but I am thinking again
 It's well said because Israel's is alow ceasefire. My request is the fighting should stop. So all the necessary job can take place.
" I cant believe, I live to see ths level of Genocide"
 The world has no place for a UN since powerfull nation can do whatever they want with impunity
" Obviously, it has to do a Russia. Why they didn't veto this? If russia said they were voting for it they would have vetoed it"
 Hypocrisy of the  West....
 If the un does what america says
 Shut down council should be shut down as it does nothing
 How is it that Israeli turn savage after what happened in the concentration camp?

" A ceasefire should have call immediately with no conditions which side is right or wrong and a solution be decided. Isn't a little too late when so many innocent people, children and babies are dead. Condemnation is another issue all together and should not be included in this resolution. A majority vote is required and such things such as veto."
" Don't expect them Zinoist to cease fire, take action and send in UN troops to achieve a ceasefire"
" United nations is now very Old and too old to work. Therefore it has to be abolished immediately and the members countries should withdraw from it. Or  let USA ,England and rest of the European 14 countries maintain it."
" Given Israeli action in Gaza, even the kids don't need to be told to hate Israel. They hate them on their actions. Israel grooms next generation of HAMAS fighters, and it will never know peace. What does Israel think these kids will do?"

" I will tell you how this massacre will go. There is this saying in Dutch: ik stond erbij en ik keek er naar. Which means they all stood there and were looking. This massacre will go on until the end. The UN will do nothing. The west does nothing, the arabs do nothing. Even if they will take netanyahu to court and even if the court will rule in favor of Palestine. Netanyahu will not give in."
 Why USA and western countries do not want peace and to being peace in this region is call for cease fire.

 Russia is standing with Israel
" From the River to the Sea,"
 Why security force fail to rescue Israel people kidnapped.
 The United Nations should be more concerned with helping Israel and the rest of the civilized world deal with Islamic terrorists.
 Why Aljazeera support Hamas..?? Why no one is talking about releasing of captured Hostages and there condition..??
 Hamas miscalculated their move to attack Israel.
" As a Westerner, this is why in addition to western media outlets, it is important to tune in to non-western reporting like Al Jazeera to get an accurate summary of both sides of the story. That way, you will be best-informed when drawing your own conclusions."
" The families and children of Gaza bear the heavy burden of unrelenting pain as they endure the harsh realities of conflict. They suffer the anguish of losing loved ones to violence, their homes reduced to rubble, and their dreams shattered by the relentless cycle of strife. The echoes of explosions reverberate through their lives, leaving scars that run deeper than physical wounds. Amidst this turmoil, they grapple with fear, insecurity, and the trauma of an uncertain future. Their innocence is stolen by the harshness of the world they inhabit, and yet, they persevere with remarkable strength, seeking a glimmer of hope in the midst of the darkness that surrounds them"
" Thank god for proper reporting of this matter and the terrible way Palestine people have been traumatised for years by Israel occupation. If you starve people, treat them like animals eventually they will rise up. I feel very sorry for the Palestine people and the awful treatment by Israel government."
" Thank you for the honest, sincere and constructive news."
" Hammas knew what they are doing, including consequences. Israel also knows what they are doing and consequences. Anyone else talking about this,possibly can‚Äôt influence their choices."
 I love this news because its real and no bullshit.....Ireland we stand with Palestine
 Loving Aljazera and all of spokesmen and women for telling the truth and saying it as it is
" I thank you for covering this. So much of the coverage focussed on the barbaric acts of Hamas without putting it in the context. I agree, most have dehumanized the Palestinian people who are now homeless living in unsafe conditions without the basic necessities of life. A situation which anywhere else in the world would receive massive public outcry. But because the west couches everything in this veil of good and evil with those in the West being the forces of good‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like a collective peer pressure on our societies to support gvt led efforts in the Middle East no matter what - without questioning their methods. That attitude is exactly what got us here and unless we are willing to admit we too are wrong‚Ä¶ nothing will change."
" I try to be as neutral as possible on this issue, but only fools could not have predicted that after Hamas fighters entered Israel en masse and started kidnapping and murdering civilians living there. Israel will respond in a very harsh way. In addition, the attack by the Militants of a concert where young people were having fun will lead to public opinion in other countries turning away from Polestyn."
" Our prayers go out, and we pray for peace."
" Thank you, thank you, thank you, I love and appreciate all of your guest speakers. They are informed humanity. Bless them Jewish people of all people. How can they think it's okay to take other people's freedom away so they can have freedom. How can this be?"
" Nothing is right with any of this... however- murder, rape and kidnapping is not the answer to any problem. You cant not kill people and say its justified."
 We all brothers and sisters let's make peace please
 All‚Äôs fair in love and war. Don‚Äôt start what you can‚Äôt finish.
" Targeting innocent civilians in retaliation for terrorist attacks is inhumane. Legitimate governments should act responsibly, avoiding indiscriminate harm to ordinary people. Vengeance-driven actions like cutting supplies are not long-term solutions. Our actions today shape the future for generations to come. Let's learn from the past and not repeat its mistakes. Just my two cents"
 They always seem to forget there's an Egyptians border for Gazan citizens too... but even Egypt blockades gaza because of hamas
 I‚Äôm sorry for the losses but kindly and surely why fight a loosing battle when you really surely know it‚Äôs your vulnerable who will pay the price
 Im an outsider to all this but the hatred between these 2 countries is sad both are guilty
 Can anyone explain why people can't go to Egypt for refuge? Or even Jordan? The moment Hamas launched the attack they must have known there would be consequences

" Hamas's actions, including the detention of citizens from various nations, are having a negative impact on the Palestinian cause. Releasing these individuals promptly is of utmost importance. I empathize deeply with all Gazans who will face significant challenges in the years ahead"
 She‚Äôs speaking facts
" That Minister's rhetoric reminds me of the Leningrad siege which was declared a war crime by definition of international law which Israel, supporteds by the US, have violated over & over again."
 Hamas didn't exercise any limits whatsoever.
 Israel should remember history will repeat itself
 He didn‚Äôt call Palestinians ‚Äúhuman animals‚Äù he was referring to Hamas. And I fail to see where he was wrong
 Thank you for a sane discussion of the current events.
" This conflict is adding to our global economic challenges we've already suffered because of the Russia=Ukraine conflict the world economies are still getting to grips with the climate change effects and the post pandemic effects,so do we really need heads of states and govt officials from western capitals calling for war or more conflicts really!!!"
 I can understand how the Israeli blockade has had deleterious effect on the people of Gaza but what I don't understand is why Al Jazeera (among others) never speak of the effect of Hamas' rule has upon inspiring that blockade. Hamas has declared in their charter that they wish to destroy Israel; hence the blockade. Furthermore I'd like to know why they never talk about the fact that there have been no elections in Gaza since 2006?
 Really... what hope is there for long lasting peace between the two?? So much bad history. So much sorrow. So much loss. So much damage. So much hatred. So much revenge. Have they reached the point of no return??
 What would be an ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù response from Israel in front of such barbaric attack?
 it would be very hard for them to get international support after they filmed their atrocities and uploaded them for the whole world to see
" What Hamas did was aufull.  However, I'm afraid Israel has been given a blank check.  Anything less than total destruction of Gaza is considered ""antisemitism"".  The potential for catastrophe is very high.  At some point we need to draw a distinction between ""self-defense"" and ""revenge""."
 problem is both sides are so defensive an blame the other... its bad marriage I would say... in some point they need to find a peace...
 More than 50% of population in Gaza is under age of 18y old
" How can there ever be peace when each side believes they are just, the other side is wrong, and compromise is a betrayal?"
" You have arab nations around Palestine, but non wants them in their lands especially the gulf states, yet they send them to Europe, they were once asked about it, they said their region is very aggressive,and they do not want non of it."
 This is inhuman.
 JUST PRAYING FOR THE WORLD TO HAVE PEACE AGAIN.
" In the end, if you take the attitude that might is right, you will probably end up regretting it."
" One of the problems here is that there‚Äôs no reason for Israel to deescalate or negotiate for peace. The Israeli government has declared war, it needs to show its people results and severe retaliation to sure-up their own positions and satisfy its peoples need for revenge. Given what Hamas has done this time, I don‚Äôt want to imagine what is going to be placed on the scale before things are close enough to even."
 :
 People are born in Gaza and are not refugees but citizens!
 I lift up my prayer for peace to take place
" It's so sad, this has been on going for centuries (around 6 BC)  death, deprivation and despair. Both sides have been killing each other. Both sides want peace but both sides unwilling to budge. I don't understand how a country can carry out an attack on Israel knowing that their most needed livelihood comes from and through Israel....water, food electricity..at least that's what the news says"
" say no to war on both sides, its exactly what they want, we got to forgive heal and move on as a human being"
" It's hard to feel sorry for either Isrealis or Gaza at this point. An Eye for an Eye lives the world blind. Hamas' inhumane attack will only leave thousands of Gazans dead or homeless after Isreal's war, leaving them angry and wanting more bloodshed. Repeating the cycle. I now find myself without feeling for either of them."
 Hopefully the two sides read all of our YouTube comments and realize we want peace
" On one hand, we have Hamas labeled as a terrorist group, while on the other, Israel is called a terrorist state. It's a peculiar kind of balance, don't you think?"
 A siege is a historically effective recourse against an entrenched enemy. The barbaric infiltration of Hamas gave Israel sufficient political cover and justification for war declaration which includes siege against enemy territory as a justified military action.
" If it's any consolation, the destruction you see is localized to one neighborhood  of Gaza city. It was a neighborhood where Hamas operated from."
" ""International laws"" of conflict only applies to established national armies. If the Palestinians (and Hamas) want these protections, put on uniforms and identify yourselves as an army."
 The best news ever with THE WHOLE TRUTH being revealed. Thank you
" Why is it so difficult to understand that the subjugation and oppression of a population over 50 years, taking away their rights, killing and imprisoning them will lead to this type of situation. Violence will result only in violence. This is not the first conflict only difference is that Hamas has invaded Israel unprecedentedly and killed Israelis indiscriminately. This was a pressure cooker situation that was waiting to burst open. Btw m not justifying the actions of Hamas or Israel"
" Simply unforgivable, Israel will not ever forgive this."
" The question we must ponder is: who is responsible for creating these conditions of misery in Gaza, akin to an open-air prison? Understanding the reasons behind this predicament is crucial. To break the siege, we must first comprehend its origins. Life in Gaza has become bleaker than death, prompting one to wonder about the roots of these fertile grounds for extremist ideologies. It is wisdom that seeks answers and solutions in order to alleviate the suffering of those in Gaza."
" They must be given medical supplies. Given injury is one thing, preventing treatment is still another."
" I think they know where the 5 thousand plus rockets came from, and that makes them a military installation. If they exposed their positions they might have a better chance."
" By this time ,Israeli should be more Modern and professional in its activities in Godley manner against those terrorists or its enemies.."
" leader of Hamas who ordered the attack on Israel over the weekend. He is currently living in Qatar and reportedly watched the aggressions from the comfort of his office."" - What a great leader."

" Saudi Arabia Stand Up. In light of the current situation, I earnestly request the support and intervention of Saudi Arabia in fostering peace. Your influence and diplomatic efforts can play a crucial role in bringing about a resolution to the conflict. I urge you to engage in diplomatic dialogue, advocate for de-escalation, and work towards creating a peaceful environment for all parties involved. Your commitment to stability and cooperation can make a significant impact on the lives of those affected."
" Gaza looks like Lahaina, Hawaii.  January 6th here in America comes to mind.  Some say the crowds were allowed into the Capital to justify a hard response.  Was Hamas ""allowed out"" to justify a complete wipeout of Gaza?  In the end, a land grab?"
" How can Israel blockade Gaza when it borders Egypt in the west? Unless Israel also invaded Egyptian Sinai. Is Egypt supplying Gaza through that border? If not, why not? Are they trying and Israel is firing upon Egyptian relief convoys?  I'm not being flippant. Genuinely wondering."

 If you do something bad you'll get something worse
 What have we become
" If somehow someone does not like its neighbours, they fight about leaves in the garden, fences, noise, pets etc. and they have gone so far to engage courts to settle their issues and now one throws all its garbage over the fence and is later finding out they actually depend on the other, as they only access their house over the others land, find out that the water supply to the own land as well flows through the neigbour and finally that electricity come from there as well. I would question myself what have they thought first place. If people are not friendly with neighbours it always ends bad."
" The fact one entity  has control over cutting off water, gas, electric, food and medical supplies of the entire region, appears unreal, undemocratic, injustice, colonism and apartheid."
 Good job keep it up
" So, on the one hand, she wants to condemn barbarity, but two breaths later, she wants to reward barbarity."
 Its a genocide. Awful. God help us all.
" ""When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty."" Thomas Jefferson"
 I don't understand why he failed to mention how densely populated Gaza is?!?!?!
 The prayer of the oppressed does not go unheard. Allahu Akbar
" Here's how much the situation has been normalized in Gaza.... a man was standing in the rubble of his apartment building. He said an entire family was killed and they never got a text to warn them the building would blown up. My God?! Just imagine that it's part of everyday life that you expect to get a text like that... GM u hve 5min to get out, thx IDF"
 Yet Russia was condemned for the same. Israel is doing exactly what Russia is doing
" Why does it take so long, for GAZA that has been turned into a fortress, it would roughly take half a million troops, so they are not going to do that.. since Isreal doesn't want to expend a half million troops for GAZA, so they rather starve them shell them into oblivion, or make the civilians flee so only combatants are left. sooner or later HAMAS has to decide lose the human shields or starve and have weaken defenders."
 Start stupid wars - win stupid prizes.
 thank you for a calm depiction of the story from the view of the people of gazza
" As long as Palestinians were dying at the hands of Israel, there was no effort or desire for peace. I hope now they might rethink and make an effort to do something. Looking at the statement coming from the West my hopes seem misplaced. My mediocre Canadian leadership (both in the government and the opposition) rallying in support for Israel while Israel is engaged in applying collective punishment to all Gazans to avenge Hamas's crimes by cutting off food, water and electricity to all Gazans."
 What you reap is what you sow. Every action has their repercussion.
 Israel for humanitarian purposes should designate a safe OPEN area for ALL Gazans to locate to maybe the entire Gaza coastline to be an artillery-free zone and warn Hamas NOT to use their own people as human shields.
" It will be very difficult to forgive such killings made by hammas , but this war have to end ,, innocent lives are being lost ,so many children killed already"
 Sad
" Never Forget. Never Again. It is a solemn reminder for all of us to be vigilant against injustice, hatred, and prejudice that can lead to catastrophic events. always strive to reject any form of extremism, including Hamas, and work towards building a world where everyone can live without fear of violence or discrimination."

 After studying this topic I have realized that 1. peace is not possible unless one party is out there....for eternity....even if both parties agree...some offshoot who claims otherwise will come and change the status quo.   2. Even the Palestinians and many world leaders don't want to get this solved. It's a multi billion dollar donation industry and garners votes in many country. It's ultimately people who suffer. 3. Frankly no one cares....otherwise they would have talked sense and not keep talking about revenge and celebrate on day 1. 4. Does God really exists....if there was one why do we keep fighting in the name of God. Is God asking us to kill each other ..

" All these killings just for a parcel of land.God created earth for everybody, regardless of our race,religion and etc.but why we couldn‚Äôt live together side by side as brothers .There is enough space for all of us."
 Why is every news channel labeling this conflict as Israel - Palestine conflict  and never Palestine- Israel? Just an observation.
" Calling these terrorists ‚Äòhuman animals isn‚Äôt what led to ‚Äòsiege‚Äô , their murderous behavior over the weekend is  what caused it."
" So, how exactly should we expect Israel to react?"
 The UN should step in and let Israel know that treating people like that will definitely start a all out war against Israel.
 Both side are as bad as each other and have never got on and this conflict has been going on for 100s of years
" funnily enough, israeli might agree to that."
" Please stop killing equal human beings in the name of religion whatever it may be.  Prayers for Peace,  both sides.  Please allow Neutral Nations to make Reconciliation and a Peace Agreement to resolve all reasonable grievances"
" In Brazil, we are praying for YHWH to intervene for the Jews and Palestinians, we are brothers and we have to see that there is sadness, pain, death and tears on both sides ü•π"
" I‚Äôm so sad for the ppl, I can‚Äôt. Israel sent a warning (like they been doing for yrs to bomb a building) to the citizens to go to the center city by the refugee camp and Israel bombed that whole area. Children, woman thought they were safe. Tell me that wasn‚Äôt a clear setup to massacre them."
" God gave us many gifts one being free will free thinking...sadly some people use their free will and free thinking to do evil deeds, when they should be using their free will and free thinking for good."

" In other to solve a problem, it does not help to take sides at all"
" The Russian Ministry of Defense should watch carefully and take notes! Notice how Israel can just level entire blocks of heavily populated cities (some of the densest in the world), demolish highrise buildings with civilians still in them, and there isn't even a mouse squeak among all the chattering governments of duplicitous Western countries. It means Russia, too, can do exactly the same to Ukraine's leadership what Israel is trying to do to Hamas' leadership. The West isn't qualified to talk about Russia using Kinzhals, FABs, Iskanders taking out central Kiev and the Ukrainian government while Israel is levelling Gaza."
 The people that planned and participated in the territory attacks a few days ago are exactly what they were described as‚Ä¶. Human animals.
 Quite stupid if you are still dependent on your enemy after 56 years.
 We must implement accountability for murder and protection for all civilians always -- together.  Surely we can agree on so little when so much is at stake?
 War never will win untill Humanity...

 She's so brave!
 There are people saying that the weapons used by the Palestinian were weapons given to Ukraine by the west

" I am stunned to hear that Al Jazeera is completely ignoring the fact that Hamas struck Israel first. To hear these people speak it's as if Palestine did nothing at all. However, Hamas did do something very very wrong by attacking Israel, and Israel has every right to retaliate. Why is the truth not discussed?"
" What u did what you get, don't blame people."
 BiBi most likely wanted some sort of attack to use it to exterminate Palestinians and make his new plan to come true. He just never imagined it would be this sever.
 This time the atrocities are on both sides
" So Hamas ""threatens"" to livestream murderings?! Parading naket trophies through the cheering crowds?! WTF? Act like Deash be"
" Shocker, PLO spokesperson doesn't like Israel, but prefers to be in Israel instead of in Gaza with ""her people"""
 It‚Äôs hard to believe a group of men would kill babies young kids and women the way they have. The world is watching this play out and we all need to do better and make peace and harmony not wars.
 War ctime charges against Hamass  must be tried and face the death penalty
 It is not a conflict. It is holy war of good on evil. Al Jazeera everybody knows whose side you are.

" Wait,  isn't Gaza on the border with Egypt?   Why isn't anybody blaming Egypt for not letting anything across their border with Gaza?   Israel is a separate country and so is Egypt.  The blame should be shared.  As for international law isn't it illegal as per international law to kill 700 Israel civilians??"

" Although it‚Äôs true that both sides have contributed to this conflict, there is nothing that justifies the actions of Hamas over the last week. It‚Äôs truly horrific, and justifying by saying ‚Äúwell what did you expect‚Äù is psychopathic. Also this is hardly unbiased, the Israeli man barely spoke."

 If they don't like the violence they should end the occupation.
" There will be retribution in the most unlikely place. Fire, coming from heaven devouring the center of it all!"
 maybe you should have stored food and water instead of weapons
" They seems to endorse killing children, women and unarmed civilians. Any goodwill people have towards Palestine has diminished by the actions of the Hamas. And to have these ladies sitting here glorifying what Hamas did is just horrifying. And the host is so shxxxty that he keeps cutting off his guests from talking."
" I briefly looked at the lands of these people. They have farm land, trees, and commercial buildings. I seen fresh water for irrigation. I want to go back and look to see if they have a de-salt-ation plant."
 Israel is doing the right thing. They are reacting to an action.
 Aljazeera can there be unbiased and fair contributions to the realistic context of the issue/crisis
 This conversation is insane. Israel had no control over the actions of Hamas.
 Thank you
" UN why is this happening? Would this have happened if Hamas did not provoke Israel, NO, you can say  17 yrs or 100yrs it still boils down to the fact the the cause of what is happening in Gaza now is the result of Hamas irresponsible barbaric attack on Israel, Hamas should have thought about its people and the repercussions they would face before trying to act as foolish heros when infact the world see them as barbaric animals."
" This is why our American framers were adamant about separation of church and state, because without that this would be happening way more then it is right here in the US. Knowing our current discord is thanks to all the republican Sunday morning Christians."
 Both powers of Pakistan and Israel must come together and make peace!!!
" Wellll, where‚Äôs the UN been for the past decades to help with this!?  And to set there and say how dare they when this is a battle going on for centuries"
" Great to hear how objective Al Jazeera has become, haha :D my question is, why even pretend?"

 Why do we only hear one side of the story has to be more to this attack just asking
" Let Israel and Gaza Square it out themselves.  Gaza knew Israel will retaliate after them invading and killing 900 Israeli.  These are 2 brothers fighting each other. And they believe old laws, tooth for tooth."
 Why not presenting Israeli-Palestinian case to the International Court and follow the decisions?
 Good and fair reporting. Much respect.
" Israel has no right to call them human animals that's unacceptable, i am not taken side but why they occupied Palestine land"
 All Palestinian politics is rooted in the Palestinian right of return. There is absolutely zero possibility that Israel will hand over the government to a Palestinian government in the way South Africa's Apartheid government handed over to Nelson Mandela. That is why there is war. Why don't the Palestinians accept full and final compensation for the nakba?
 Kids paying the price for the decisions of grown-up.  Poke the lion and get attacked indiscriminately. What did they think was going to happen. There has to be a better way.

 Just like early north America has said of native Americans in western United States since Columbus landed in the east coast.
" I do not care whether it was right or wrong. I care that it was predictable. And I worry were the basic assumption leads. The basic assumption being that, getting tough on a problem will fix it. Obviously, if getting tough on Palestinians would fix them, then the current situation would not obtain because the Palestinians have already been subject to that toughness to prevent this very outcome. Blinkered devotion to the assumption leads to a ""final solution"". Be so tough as to exterminate the individuals who create the problem. As Netanyahu, Hitler's padawan, preaches. How Israel can be so blind to the similarities between their treatment of Palestinians and kristallnacht and its aftermath, so myopic while traveling toward a final solution, beggars me. For a final solution is the only solution available to those who insist that toughness is the answer, when toughness proves not to be the answer. If Biden and others stopped drinking lulu juice from the lala tree, and cared less about the violations that hamas committed, and more about the fact that hose violations could have been predicted and prevented then we could sleep better in the belief that the same situation will not be revisited."
 Israel has the right to defend themselves. Hammas must face the consequinses of their action on saturday.GOD BLESS Israel!!!
 Why supply your enemy with goods and services to come back and attack you.
 They need to release the hostages. The longer they hold the hostages the longer this battle will go on. Prayers for Israel
 This is all terrible.... but what did they think the result of the October 7 attacks would be?
 We can not disrespect animals and comparing them to viciousness of Hamas
 I do feel saddened by the deaths of the innocent people dying in Israel and Gaza caused only by the terrorist group of Hamas.
" Under article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter, All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations."
" Harma broke the rule of war,so their citizens should face the consequences"
 FU Gaza
 Should‚Äôve considered those consequences before palistines made the attack
 When media houses take sides
" I suspect within ten years we will ask ourselves how it was possible that Israel committed so many genocides against the palestinians, just like we cannot grasp what Germany did to the jews."
" It seems like the world has decided to let the Palestinian people slowly be ethnically cleansed from the earth. It‚Äôs heartbreaking, but who can help if all major nations turn a blind eye?"
 There is two countries established by great Britain think tank in 1947/48 . They are more communal & violent . They can't live together . Western countries political leaders are enjoying with the words strategy & diplomacy .
" It really is unexceptable for Israel to do this. The UN resolution on apartheid includes that Palestine has the right to defend itself. This has been going on since 2006, Israel encroaching and taking Palestinian land killing indescrimetely and controlling their water, electricity, and calorie input is inhumane to human beings yet THEY call them animals."
 I didn't see them saying this when the world cup was on ...about Qatar funding Al Jazeera.......unbelievable!!!
 People at war...and the news interviewing those rich people staying comfortable at home........WTF they know......

 Israel is the only State in middle East which has the freedom to do what ever it wants with support of USA and other western countries.
 1) Israel accepted UN partition in 1947 but Arab countries along with Palestine rejected the partition and started war against Israel.
 We salute the strength and courage of the Palestinian people and are in full solidarity with them.
 NO water!  NO food!  NO fuel!  NO electricity!
 Any light on the weapons used by hammas? Where were from?
 US ships would not be far from coast. Say 200 to 300 nautical mile at best. With sophisticated Russian or chinese mid range anti ship missiles (say df 21)  it would not be hard job for yemenis or Lebanese to sink boats in mediterranian or red sea or in the horn without directly involved as US involvement in ukraine.
" This is just, the fulfilment of the bible prophecy, we must learn more about the end  times and also the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ  is now approaching , if we  study bible prophecy, we can understand all what was happening today in Israels troubled"

" You should shout at Hamas why he is causing his people such trouble.

" If this keeps up it wont be ""Densely Populated"" for much longer."
" First of all, I am a big fan of Al Jazeera English, and Inside Story in particular, because every side is represented so one hears every one's point of view. At least, in general, it wasn't exactly the case this time: the operator had to bring some of Israel viewpoints in the conversation, because no one else did. It took almost the whole conversation until the very last person who said something condemned what happened over the weekend. So, I guess the general consensus is that murdering Israelis is perfectly legal and understandable. But, even then, why on earth should a country be expected to keep on delivering electricity to its enemy, who murders as much as possible, once the opportunity is there? What I didn't hear is that there is a border with Egypt too. For such a small piece of land, one entry would be enough to provide the population with what it needs, and trade and an economy would be possible. So, apparently electricity and food should only come from inside Israel; Egypt can do - or not do - whatever it wants. Finally, what kind of occupation or blockade is it, where Hamas can get whatever it needs to produce rockets on an industrial scale, to dig tunnels, to obtain weapons, and to get in and out with them?"
 As a Palestinian I respect piers Morgan. Honestly. He‚Äôs not biased.
" Gaza residents that remain are in the line of fire. They know what's going on. They can flee, but remain. They're on their own.  Grievances may be real and justified, but what Hamas has done is inexcusable."
" ‚ÄúFor nation will rise against nation,and kingdom against kingdom.And there will be famines,pestilences,and earthquakes in various places.All these are the beginning of sorrows. Matt24‚Ä¨:‚Ä≠7‚Ä¨-‚Ä≠8‚Ä¨"
 You do the crime you  face the consequences
 The struggle of the Palestinian people against its oppressors (Both the apartheid state and Hamas militants) should be the struggle of all of us and is an example of historical resistance. Stop the killings of innocents please!
" There is a saying dear, you can't be feeding an enemy, and still be engaged in war,you need to take away their live hood"
" Where are the Hamas backers like a iran, now iran says they are not behind."
 Selective application of international is a source of extra judicial executions of political rivals. Innocent civilian slaughter in pursuit of racial bigotry and the annexation of the land on religious ground. A durable solution is required and it lies in the two state solution
" If they would give up the location of the paramilitary instead of harbouring them, and pretending they are martyrs. Then there might be some believability to the claims."

 To achieve peace is what starvation
 Our prayers for Israelis
 He never said palistinia are animals..he said we will fight both humans and animals which mean we are going to fight every there...am not in support of war but why did hamans start this when he no the consequences..must it be war to end the setuation to put humans  in dengers.
 There is no justice in the world
 The World needs more Women in Politics!
 THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT MUST ISSUE WARRENTS OF ARREST FOR ALL HAMAS COMMANDERS AND KILLERS
" They dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious. ‚ÄòPeace, peace,‚Äô they say, when there is no peace."
" I am sorry for humanity!!! And I wish this is not happening. Why would you start what you cannot finish? Especially when at any time and prediction, you will always be the loser? You gave the Israelis a ‚Äòbig‚Äô justification for the retaliation!!! It is quite unfortunate!!!"
 is using children as a human shield not illegal under international law?
" Those people behind the reporter in Gaza seem walking about normally. They were celebrating when Hamas butchered Israeli civilians. Now Hamas stupidity is going to cause Gaza to collapse, I doubt those celebrating Gaza will get my sympathy. My donation for humanitarian aid will go to people who lost loved ones in Israel. I'm sorry but that's my logic."

" If Russia had done to ukraine what Israel did to Gaza, I am sure all of you, including your tv station, did not waste any second to condemn Putin."
 Whoever is giving them the fire power is who gets to harbour them. How can a city with 50% unemployed arm so many people?
" Why all coutries like egipt, libanon, siria, etc all arabic wrold cant suply gaza in food , electricity and water?"
" First, what should we call the humans responsible for these atrocities?  The Hamas attack was terrorism and targeted civilians, with a maximum of brutality.  The Israelis can hardly be blamed for going on a war footing, including a determination to eliminate such a threat to their existence.  Second, the Palestinians failed for decades to accept any peace offering, and to make any realistic offers.  Israel is real, and must be accepted.  The Palestinians have had a difficult time accepting Israel's existence.  Resorting to terrorism and brutality against babies, elderly, non-combatants - as a strategy to be proud of - is not only not helpful.  It positively invites demonization.  Palestinians did not accept peace in 1948, and have not since.  Israel must fight or be destroyed, thanks to the Palestinian refusal to offer any kind of peace."
 It is good to hear some comments which are the root of the cause.The Israelis will never have a permanent peace with the Palestinians until they are willing to offer them a better life.
" If anything God opposes this war but the arms suppliers do not , whom supply armaments and equipment to the starters of this war hamas? whom supplies weapons to the suppliers of arms to hamas? Anyone any comment?"
" ""...no safe place in gaza..."""
" Al Jazeera does not speak about war crimes of Haza strip people, only about consequences of retaliation. Actions have consequences."
 Israeli have suffered they were slaves they were kicked out their land had to live all over the world so if anyone's has suffered is the Israeli people we going back thousands of years and the history how they got their land back and who helped them and their first fight to win their first fight its alot of fighting these people deserve to defend Israel üáÆüá± God bless
" Cutting off the water, supplies and food should be considered a war crime ."
 Our leaders may support Israeli apartheid but we do not.
 Where is going on humanity's. What's happening both side. Need paceful solutions.both side effects civilian. Innocent people died why ? Both side which human animals are understand. Because all are same. . Who is feel for a human.
" Once Israel occupies Gaza, then they are responsible for the population.  If you are at war, you are not responsible to feed and give electricity to the enemy."
 üáµüá∏
 Hamas called their attack a victory....why are the complaining now? Don't stop Israel.
" Glad to see Francesca shoot down the Mass Murder Is Justified Lady from earlier. Palestinian response to Israeli occupation has to follow some sort of ethics, or the Palestinian people will lose the support and sympathy of the world."
 Israel is not responsible for what Hamas has caused. There‚Äôs a reason so many support Israel.
" Human animals, interesting"
 Jazeera is way better than Sky and others. At least showing both sides
 The Love of God to Israel and his promised to Fr. Abraham is written in the scriptures:
 The day of the lord jesus is coming! Lets behold and praise the great savior of mankind.
 Respect is a two way street!!! Nobody‚Äôs better than nobody!!!
" Just before Oct 7th Attack, Wasn't Palestinian's allowed into Israel for work, for attending to their basic necessity? I was told, slowly the situation was getting better, and just then the Oct 7 happended. Someone pls clarify."
 I am all for a free and independent Palestine.
 Who could stop this soo early when they took hostages and paraded some dead people to show as trophies. I don't think most people want to meddle in the conflict just yet. There will not be any peace untill later.
 Palestine needs a independent state.
 nothing has brought humanity more pain and suffering than religion.
 Well done Al Jazeera for broadcasting the truth
 Peace and freedom for Palestinians

" ‚ÄúSome actions ‚Äì like cutting electricity and food for civilians ‚Äì are against international law,‚Äù he said."
 At last someone or few people to tell the truth
 Human animals indeed
 Israel is not a country but a sophisticated military base for America and Western countries. and his master was clapping his hands as he watched them fight
 The speech in which Israel talked about fighting human animals was like watching Hitler talk about the Jews...
 You should think about this before you start a war.
 May Allah protect the innocent women and children from this bloodthirsty Netanyahu government.
 3000 ppl lost life for what ? Hamas need to think about its shameless acts
" The people of Gaza had their chance for peace. That time is over now. Now they will suffer the consequences of their actions. Hopefully, their children do will not suffer too terribly, but they have only their parents to blame."
 I would like to congratulate Palestinian mother's who gave birth to brave boy and girls who have sacrificed their life fighting the injustice occupation and blockade who are fighting for their right for self determination.
 While  Iran and Qatar laugh.
 Gaza: A taste of your own medicine. How do you like it?
 International law like the one Hamas is following?
 Why is the world not talking about this cutting everything will not stop anything
" Netanyahu few days ago held up a Map of Israel in the UN in his usual hubristic, arrogant, provocative style showing a non-existent Palestine."
" not only they are bombing the Gaza , but also shutting down all supplies to the Gaza..Who's the human animal now?"
 You hit a lion & now you‚Äôre crying..? Really.? Deal with it & good luck with that.! I Won‚Äôt help you crying
 She called them military forces. LOL is that what we are calling terrorists now ?
" They supplied electricity, medicine, food, money ,work permits etc but due to war imposed by Arabs and hostages taken they are unable to continue."
 Are humans fundamentally evil or good? Our history says that we are evil.
" This is not good on both sides, no one can do anything about it."

 Retaliation has no measurement! So when people play barbaric games they‚Äôll win barbaric prices not so much love and support!
 Should have considered the consecuences before letting Hamas animals led that terrible attack.
" Before UN says humanitarian corridors. it failed for Ukraine in Mariupol. remember.. so Isreal learned that too, F off UN they would say."
 Hamas had opportunity to go and attack military installations in Israel but they choose to go after young children and old women. They just gave Netanyahu the ammunition he needs to do whatever he wants to do.
 Well thats what happens when you Attack Someone... And your Smaller... and their is a Thing Called Government even i Have had Court cases where it the US Vs Me... You just dont take on SUPER POWERS... Their Are JUSTICE
 Peace international
" i dont think people are blaming the palestinians in general....they are blaming hamas. The argument of decades of oppression doesn't justify killing civilians in israel coz if other people think it is justified, then that decades of oppression will just continue....and this will just go in circles...and more civilians will be dead..."
 Notice how at the time of
" Who started it now??, now pay the price. U attack those who fed u."
" Attack with paragliders a country that has jets, they shouldn't cheer too soon."
 It is cowardly of iran to deny hamas at this stage. Very significantly cowardly
 Hamas Kullu country urban country the Muslim Desh 57 country Muslim country damas madad the mafiyana ki Hamas my Mushkil ab baccha Mushkil the Baba Mushkil Baba ramas madad Ada Muslim Muslim bhai bhai ramawas madad karo Israel ka bahut julm ho gaya hai Baap Har country madad kar sakte hain Amavas Ki madad kar sakti hai bahut pareshani Amavas ho rahi hai
 Total blocage is genozide
 Hamas should have considered this human catastrophe before their action in Israel. They started this particular round of bloodshed. It is a pity. Israel will have to do what they have to do to prevent Israelis.
 Ask Hamas to repay and rebuild for what they have started.
 He thinks Israel will give up the siege once images of people starving come out?
 Palestinos
 Their not cheering now are they .
 Palestinian peoples suffering started when they started first war against Israel in 1948 right after Britain and UN made two countries.
 Thanks for showing the palestinian side the truth wiil hopefully sink in to the world to blacklist Isreal but the Muslim world need to come together and stand to these Atrocities
 To start Palestinian need to admit the wrong of Hamas attacking Israel and killing Israelis last Saturday. I already watched debate earlier today with the Israelis and Palestinians and one of the reasons they spoke over each other was the Palestinian man made many excuses and not once condemned the actions of Hamas on the Jews.
 Qus - What does Hamaz want?? - Freedom for Gaza or eradicating Israel from map. Can any one educate me

" History didn't begin on Saturday, but it did restart.  I lost all sympathy for Gaza since then.  The West Bank still has my support.  But not Gaza."
 The action of Israel is out humanity . I wonder when people speaks about Israel 's  religion .
 These people are like good therapy good medicine

 I thought Al Jazeera could be a reasonably balanced media outlet. This is horribly 1 sided reporting. I need to find a new source of information unfortunately.
 These talking heads don‚Äôt offer any solutions.  They pick a side and moan about atrocities of the other side conveniently never offering a solution.  What‚Äôs the solution??
 I Pray for Israel

When Israel was founded, there was never any talk of expelling these Arab residents of the new state. On the contrary: Anyone who declared their support for Israel was allowed to keep their land and also received all civil rights of the State of Israel. But in 1968, when President Nasser called on the Arab population to leave Israel as quickly as possible because he would raze this Jewish state to the ground, thousands fled to the surrounding countries. However, Nasser's promise vanished into thin air and the ""refugees"" lived somewhere and had lost their home (namely Israel). And now we Westerners are babbling about ""the Palestinians"" who have no rights and by that we mean the extremists who are hostile to the state of Israel and who have just proven again how peaceful they are...! Please open your eyes and ears and FINALLY get behind the history books"
 IF U UNDERSTAND  THE BACKGROUND STORY OF WHY HAMAS ATTACKED THE MUSIC FESTIVAL... U WILL  100% SIDE WITH PALESTINIANS
" Dehumanizing?  Hamas' attacks were dehumanizing, as usual."
 Starvation is not a crime after your own people have been kidnapped abd killed .... ut can be justified

" God bless Israel, God bless IDF."
 Human animals ? WTF
" Regardless of who's in the wrong or right.... my line is drawn with beheading of children and rape of women and direct and deliberately killing civilians... thats not human.  I don't care how passed one can be but you don't kill, mutilate, torture and rape people, let alone innocent civilians... that IS NOT OK, and of course some reaction is gonna be made to this"

 Exactly
 You miss the whole point.What is being done is a dress rehearsal of what is coming when one word religeon  soon come.Opposers of that system will be similarly and worser treated. This is the point.
" Just imagine if God did not give His people wisdom to create iron dome, the amount for rockets still flying now, is everyone blind to that?"
 Who are the animals?
" Palestine could have a productive, happy life. All they have to do is make friends Israel. What did they expect? Would happen when they pull the tail of a tiger?"
 Well Done Israel üáÆüá±
 Harvard isn't what it used to be.
 ...No worries Gaza  ...3600000 troopa are on the way  ...They Will Change Things For The Better!   ....Enjoy!
" Does Hamas follow international & Human Rights Law?  No. The Palestinians should never have let the Hamas Terrorists speak for them, but they did. Hamas is widely supported by Palestinians which means they are complicate by law."
 He called hamas human animals
" Saudi should take some of these guy ..as refugees..Qatar, Iran Lebanon..and many more"
 A barbaric act of hamas! But at the same time Isreal has acted barbaric against the palistinians for decades and still doing it!
 What were these people expecting?? Were they expecting isreal to send candies to hamas??? If the Palestinians can rejoice over the killing of Israelis by hamas then be prepared to cry as well.
 The world should take action against  the war crimes Israel is committing towards Palestine civilians.
" If the international leaders n arab leaders communities would stop the israel of the inhumane towards the Palestinians, this war would never happen...but the israel always play the victims when they have been killing Palestinians for over 70 yrs...Palestinians lives matters...may God help n protect the Palestinians...long live Palestine."
" The house of Saud might finally get their wish,  the destruction of Iran."
 This discussion is very one sided!
 I think palestinian should give up there rights being individual and join Israel with equal Israeli citizen and get over with this casualties on both sides otherwise its just news for rest of others
 Good go Israel

" There are difference between collateral civilian casualty and beheading/slaughtering children in front of their family, killing people point blank. And people of Gaza mostly supported and voted for Hamas. PLO Israel and even Arab nations were moving towards two state solution, but Palestinian wanted to wipe out Israel and all of land for themselves. They chose war and terrorism, how can you support them now ? There are very few innocent children and people who don't support Hamas. But most of them are not so innocent."
" That is the reaon why the State of \ Israel was created, everyone must remember that"
 The End of HAMAS
 Nice wording and order of context Al-Jazeera.
 Arab countries here we're all puppies
 who holds a rock concert in the israeli desert w/out security ?
 Hamas took western citizens...shireen s status as a dual citizen did not cut any ice with the USA
 I'm here to hear the other side
" Madam: what is proportionality in your view? 1000 innocent civilians (babies, elderly, women) in Israeli wee bombed and butchered and hostages taken brutally  in a barbaric way . What should they do? These Hamas are not human beings. I have not heard 1 person condemn the brutal attack ?"
" Poor al jazeera, everyone knows their agenda"
 Hamas needs to give up
 I don't understand why Israel is doing this. It makes no sense?
 So  .. jusr how is Isreal supposed to go about things right now  ? ISIS has guided HAMAS.
 what international law
" The Palestinean CHRISTIANS, of which there are MANY living in Gaza, remember the 12 year old boy who was shot in the head a few months back by Israeli soldiers. They are treated like 3rd class citizens now called animals by Israel, which only enflames the people living there. Every few weeks Palestineans are booted out of their homes, many who have had generations owning their land and homes, to make way for Jewish citizens who then move into their homes or tear them down and new homes are built. I saw this report on TruNews with Rick Wiles. Maybe that is one reason these Palestineans are so violent. This does NOT EXCUSE the murderous acts they put forth on Israel tho."
 Let's not take this easy. Palestinians need freedom and independence from oppressive Israeli government. Let them have it!

 Hamas could not exist in Palestine without the support or at least compliance of the Palestinian people. What Hamas did to innocent people...they are human animals!!!   Palestine asked for this with the targeted slaughter if unsuspecting civilians  men women elderly and so many children.  That kind of threat on a countries border can't be tolerated.  At least isreal said we are comming...if your not a combatant  you should leave immediately.they could have unloaded the clip on city's right away...that would have been proportionately sound
 Remove the stars from your yards its going to get nasty
 Are the internaional law blind?
 Disgusted by atrocities against innocents BUT more disgusted that a Palestinian life is regarded as worthless and subhuman
" Mrs Buttu spoke of all different things, but did not mention just one not once what HAMAS did...it was just a bad dream for Israel...two different things...how irresponsible...."
 People who choose HAMAS as their rulers what else can they expect? Where is Palestinians resistance against HAMAS terrorist?
 now you cry but 4 days ago you were dancing pffft
 Israel and Palestine should have treated themselves as neighbors and families.
" Advise to all Gaza‚Äôns ! Start swimming, ocean is right there. That‚Äôs your escape route !"
 Israel chose the behavior and consequences.
 Conditions reflect threat risk.
 Free Palestine
 its rumored that someone destroyed the rock under the mosque which jesus preached upon
 Typical Al Jazerra. Look who ONLY they have to comment and answer questions. Totally one sided.
 End the occupation
 These terrorists that killed women and Children saturday only made the case worse for their independance tho.
" They didnt have to kill all of those Israeli civilians. They could have left gaza and did a non violent protest, then we would all be talking about it differently."
 Free Palestine.
 Why should  i give you water and food if are killing my family.

" Newton's third law is wrong. To every action,  there is not always an equal and opposite reaction."
" there is nothing humane about war...and you cannot fight terrorism while upholding the""old rules"" of war.  Those laws were established in the past as part of  treaties or during a time of truce.  When extremist groups and their sympathizers live inside the one terrritory (gaza strip)  that is crucial for the Jewish race to have protection ....then you need to occupy this as ""your side's""  military territory (regardless of religion)....when Hamas brutalized Israeli women and children....they forced the hand of their leader....and they knew it.  The Israeli government is not starving any other area....so plaestinians have always been able to live anywhere....but they have proven that living side by side was never the goal...palestinians stayed in Gaza so Hamas and other terrorists could prevent Israel from being able to protect itself.  All humans should leave Gaza right now....if you are angry at this response...then you were Pro Terrorism already.  This news story is heavily slanted to the palestinians when they are the aggressor and not the victim.... since Sat if not before"

 How about this.  Gaza stops playing the terrorist.  Israel leaves Gaza alone.

 Only a animal would chop the heads off babies
 They have been fighting ever since 1948 when the Palestinians rejected the 2 state solution in favor od driving all the jews from Israel.
" Yes, Gaza must be emptied of the Palestinians. It definitly looks like Israel is doing it."
" Continue looking for hamas until they caught, forget UN demand ,nothing happen in Russia"
 How did the killing of children in Israel comply with International Law??
 There‚Äôs still room for peace if terrorists could put aside jihad for good.
 Please show respect to animals. To compare these examples of human scum and barbarians to animals is an utter insult to animals.
 Netanyahboo:)
 No body is blaming the Hamas  for attacking Israel?
" he said Hamas, not Palestinians."
" Hamas beheaded 40 babies. 40 Indian students decapitated, Nepali students killed. Hamas has made the world turn away. And it got billions in aid from 2005. What did it do with the money. Why has Egypt blockaded Hamas?"
 Satan LOVES HATRED.
 My heart goes out to Palestians but it sounds like y‚Äôall are justifying the terrorism. I hope they can separate the two

 Not a single civilian should be targeted by both Israelis  and  Palestinians.  It is the duty of American  and European countries  to stop this war  ASAP please.
 I  am from India ;
 I love seeing all the very well fed people and those driving cars. All propaganda.
" Sorry, man, but can you stop interrupting these women while they're speaking. Let them finish their statements, jeez."
" Palestinian can respond but what happened on 10/7 was disgusting: rape, murdering babies, kidnapping children ‚Ä¶.how can anyone say this behavior is justifiable or any reasonable?"
 And so is Putin
 You lost me at calling Hamas as Palestinian fighters.
 I unsubscribed from Al Jazeera just now.
 Question to the lady have Israelis soliders ever drag women through the streets desacrating their bodies and clapping
 The first thing I did today was to cancel my subscription to the NewYorkTimes for their inaccurate and biased reporting.
" to the lawyer ,,,  1400 years ago the arabs under the disguise of their"
 Did you any of these perprator condems of terrorist attack ?
" Thank you for keeping us informed of what is happening. We are trying to stop our government from allowing this to happen, but they are SO corrupt!!!"
" How  can someone do that to human beings, such horrific, horrible acts ? Heartbreaking. It's  not one day two days, two weeks, it's been going on for the last two months, and the world is silent"
" This is absolute insanity. As an American and a Christian, it absolutely breaks my heart that so many of my peers here in the US continue to blindly support Israel. This has to stop."
 Those with the power to act against these atrocities watch in silence while the rest of us can only look on with horror at the iniquities wrought before our eyes. It's a saddening thing to witness the world devolve into something so hideous.
 Gods blessing please save the poor innocent people of Gaza.

" With every civilian man, woman and child that is killed or maimed in Gaza or the West Bank Israel is moving further and further away from a peaceful resolution to the conflict, to security for Jews in Israel, and from support from those they believe to be their allies. They are isolating themselves and putting Jews all around the world in danger. It is time for every country to unite and demand a ceasefire under the threat of severe sanctions towards both sides and to commit to real negotiations towards a fair and lasting division of land and resources."
 Media needs to speak out if this is not genocide than what is.
 Alhamdulillah alhamdulillah alhamdulillah our martyrs
 It's heartbreaking. The people of Gaza have been neglected and left to suffer more & more. It's a shame that world leaders connot act strongly to stop this brutality. Where are the international laws of humanity? Don't they apply here? We are so unfortunate to see this happening  in front of our own eyes. Yet everyone is helpless as long as the ones who can stop this (specially the US) are silent.
 The people SHOULD SEE what the IDF does to people including children in their bombing raids. It should NOT be sugar-coated. For the victims and family's sake so we see their story.

 Loss of a single life is sad. But it's equally important for these people to condemn Hamas who went to Israel to brutally massacre as many innocent children and people as time would allow them

 How can you confirm it‚Äôs an Israeli strike? It looks like more an Hamas missile that fell short of range from the impact on the roof and the surrounding damage. And how did you get this number of 50 casualties. It looks like at most dozen were killed. In TRT world they are already saying that 200 were killed. If it‚Äôs an Israeli strike be sure its by mistake. Awful mistake but it‚Äôs a war and mistakes could happen. I feel sorry for those who died in this event and be sure if it is Israel they won‚Äôt deny it.

" This is absolutely disgusting. Just makes me wonder what has happened to humanity. All of this because of Hamas.....those bastards need to be held accountable first and foremost, they are evil incarnate. As for Israel I'm sorry to say but this has gone way too far. FFS there are kids, innocent civilians that are lying in pools of blood. My heart is beyond shattered"

 The Gaza strip has been controlled by the Islamic Resistance Movement i.e. HAMAS since 2007.

" I feel so ashamed that my government is letting this happen. I can only pray and cry for these people,I feel so ashamed."
 How evil are those who want to clear their conscience by asking others to justify their cruelty
 All governments  who remain without action to stop this should be ashamed and held accountable to the fullest extent.
" Im English from England, I'm ashamed of my Country for supporting these crimes against humanity, (Genocide)"
 total heart wrenching ...inhumane acts by human animals in the name of self defense
" This is a shame to humanity and byond words. If hospitals and schools are not spared, we dont deserve to be called human."
 Dear lord I am utterly disgusted and  ashamed of lack of humanity
" It's unbelievable. How the world is letting them to do this cruelty. It's scary. All those critically injured patients are not safe and doctors are not safe. Red Cross, Criminal Court, Security Council  please keep an eye on all the patients.  THIS IS A MAJOR CRIME AND GENOCIDE"
" My heart is with the patients, brave medical staff & the Palestinian people. Im appalled beyond words that this is being allowed to happen."
 Forcing paramedics to leave at gun point while patients dying in the hospitals?

 We want all those patients and medical staff to be safe. It's horrifying
 I was born American and have lived here my whole life. I have despised my government and its foreign policy for several years ever since I began watching independent media on YouTube. Still I've flown the American flag outside my home. Because although it is my belief our leaders  are tyrants and despots I have held  a love for the American people. Today I will take the flag down in shame.
" It never ceases to amaze me the hatefulness of humans to each other. How do they expect people who are so hurt physically to ""leave"".....I don't even know how to get across the way this makes me feel"
 If someone can still stand by Israel after seeing their brutality on humanity then I don‚Äôt know how those people sleep at night.  Humanity is at a very dark moment in time.
" SHAME on the world that is allowing this to happen and especially to those that have committed this 'Crime of the Century' and those who have funded and supported them in it. They shall pay for their crimes, but that won't help the victims of it now."
" Imagine even the innocent civilians that were bombed already and can not move at all and the pre mature baby‚Äôs that more then likely were delivered pre mature because injury or major panic attacks and stress from the bombs forced those poor moms to go into labor early and still they are being tortured. Defenseless literally helpless civilians and pre mature baby‚Äôs have not yet to get a chance like all of us reading this get treated like this by Israeli soldiers. So sad, it‚Äôs so sad"
 Horrific.  This is beyond cruel and inhumane.  Shameful Israel.
 Who couldn't look at those innocent babies lying alone and cold without their mothers and now being left to die and not feel heartsick? These world leaders are as heartless as the worst terrorists!
" as a born German I could never understand ho w the Nazis could do what they did.

 I'm shocked how world has turned their eyes blind. Literally pathetic.

These doctors have been so heroic during this attack, and after all that to have a gun pointed at you and be forced under threat of murder to abandon the patients you swore an oath to care for. I can't imagine how crushing that would be. Those doctors who remained in Gaza are some of the bravest and most selfless human beings on Earth. Shame on Israel for doing this, and shame on the US for allowing it to happen."
 Truly  beyond unconscionable and beyond inhumane!
 Boycott all Israel products
" Thanks for the report, AJ. Shame on all the countries that not putting the foot down to stop the attack."
 This is harrowing the scenes along with Mohammed's account is breaking my heart. Where are our leaders around the world ? Where is the UN ?  Where is humanity  ? Where is the empathy ? I am sickened. Hang our heads in shame brothers & sisters of the human race.
" Salute And Appriciate To Al Shifa Hospital Director , - God Bless You Sir, _ Thank You, ..... Cheerio.*****."
 You can see the reluctance with which the medical staff is leaving. Each ward they passed they looked in and seemed torn about leaving. These medical staff stayed until they were forced to leave. Imagine how they must feel abandoning helpless patients in their care.
" Well, now we know that if this ever happened to any of us, no one is coming to save you"
 This is WORLD CRIME
" **The problem is that everyone knows what Hamas did on Oct 7th, but a lot of people don't know what Israel's been doing for the past 75 years. They don't want to know it, and many people in power don't want them to know it either.  And it's the biggest part of the whole picture. One can't understand what's going on without it."
 In broad daylight their actions are bold and loud.. many people still find justification and see nothing wrong. The worst of them are happy.

 Israel and the Americans and Europeans blindly supporting Israel just can not understand that there is no coming back from the abominations Israel is committing in this hospital and Gaza. The worst tactics of the Gestapo can barely compete with what Israel is doing in this hospital and Gaza.
 What is happening is unhuman
 Shame on all Arab governments who are watching this genocide and doing nothing
" Like how Israeli soldiers going into Al-Shifa had boxes with photocopied pieces of paper stuck to all sides of the boxes by hand with ""Medical Supplies"" written in english for the western audiences. Otherwise, would most military forces waste time, during a war campaign with injured civilians that they are apparently trying to ""help"", sticky taping/glueing pieces of paper with text not in the 
native language of either of the warring parties to six sides of a bunch of boxes if not specifically to make up a narrative for western audiences?"
 German Chancellor Scholz few days ago: ‚ÄùI strongly believe Israel is acting according to international humanitarian rights.‚Äú I am really extremely sad and ashamed that Germany lets this happen.

 This is a horrific nightmare.  Please our governments must make this end. What did these babies do to Israel?
 Nothing scares me more than other humans.
" As a physician, I am horrified by the brutality of the IDF‚Äôs treatment of the medical staff and patients of this hospital. This must end!"

 Doctors had to leave at gunpoint ?? Disgusting IDF

 I HAVE NO WORDS  ANYMORE FOR  THIS  HORRORRS!!!
 If they act in this horrible way now do you ever think they were nice or kind to the Palestinians ever. The world will never look at them with any respect or trust again.

 How can a human being treat another human being like this? Shame on all countries refusing calls for ceasefire!
 Share this video on every platform MSM is failing to tell thier horrific situation
 This is war crimes
 Keep fighting Palestine; do not give up. Never.

 It's really a plight to see such things  are happening.....
" West celebrities must speak for this , some of them are working with human rights organisations ,they have a strong voice too .why patients and babies are suffering this much ."
 May Allah almighty help you and the desperate people who left there.
 My God my God!!! Unbelievable what evil and full of rage and hate  people can do that. I thought since the world is civilized it could not do such atrocities with human beings. I cry and cry to see the babies gasping for air. The majority of the world is with innocent civilians but only God can stop this horrific genocide
 Why the world leave them alone?
 It is inhumane. Why haven't field hospitals been set up by now at very least?

" As a nurse I just cannot comprehend the level of suffering and endurance, of the patients,  medical stuff and all other involved in this insanity."
 Do this Israel soldiers have soul? it's not about Religion but humanity first..it's not about the land but humanity first.
 Pity for the innocent civilians.
 This is an important document that will have to be taken into account when all Israelis militaries pay for this crimes.
 These medial staffs are above perfect human beings

 Oh Allah pls protect them ... i cant stop crying
 This is insane.
 Absolute disgrace.  Will be no surprise when every survivor of this horror grows up with hate in their heart and retaliates.
 There is No Justification for Genocide

 Surreal. Just unfathomable.
 Oh my God please stop this barbaric genocidal
 God hear our prayers. Send mercy to all the people that are oppressed.
 How could the people in power let this happen?  The level of suffering  is beyond any decent humans understanding.   Who voted for this?  Not ordinary people.  Anyone making money out of this war will have no joy.
" It's hard to imagine that this is being allowed by the West in the age of mass communication. Imagine what the European did to the world, when there was no camera."
 This is torture!!!
 War crimes 101
 Where is so called western humanright organizations
" This could be done with anyone. clearly a father/relative would be ideal. Its temperature would be normal and the heartbeat would calm the baby. In this case, bottled or expressed milk would be used."
 The IDF must be held accountable for these crimes against Humanity. We are witnessing EVIL on this earth.
 Never start what you cannot stop...hence proved...God save the people.
 The situation went beyond the limits from the beginning. RAMAS urgently needs to stop using civilians to stop the war

" Heavenly Father, please intervene in this crisis to save these innocent civilians. Lord provide a way of escape for all of these injured people and all of these babies. Lord, I pray for a swift end to this war. In Jesus mighty name I pray Amen and Amen"
 I've never seen a war/invasion so live then this!!! Crazy how times have change!!
 I cannot believe we're watching this genocide in real time the whole world is watching yet US/UK/EU who could STOP the genocide in a matter of hours chose to do nothing. Absolutely horrific and sickening.
" Every soul will be accounted   for, and the devils involved will suffer unimaginable punishment from God! Anyone who can see this without any form of guilt then you are inhumane. May Allah accept all these helpless victims into his kingdom. Ameen"
 Use the hospital triage system strategy. Prioritize the patient that could survive.
 The hospital took the hostages   in and did not report ? Now that they been made accountable all this director do is complain and accuse? Thats unfair
 sounds like a lot of humiliation was going on. Some people like that.
" Netanyahu lacks human feeling. He is a killer of innocent people, babies & severely wounded civilians. Politicians from all countries who have not acted to stop him and his murdering soldiers are just as guilty by their inaction. Shame on the world for not making Netanyahu stop his illegal invasion & mass murder in Gaza. SHAME on you all."
" it is very understandable that the Hamas director of this Hamas Hospital tries his best the make this tragedy looks like being the fault of ""the israeli soldiers who deny them the right to stay ""in front of the Hamas' Headquarter's main entrance. What is not understandable is that he is not supposed to put his patients at risk."
 All of these documentaries must be saved and made available to UN and ICC asap.
 American citizen life is the most important than any other life
 How Evil are they
" Someone well rooted in heartlessness would support this particular scene as ‚Äúa necessary defense for what Hamas did‚Äù, and they‚Äôd illuminate the fact they know nothing of the situation other than their hatred for others who aren‚Äôt them or their loved ones, and their willingness to participate in the Genocide of a people they‚Äôre too ignorant to understand or empathize with."
" I imagine how barbaric and inhumane Israel's behavior was in that hospital at that time.  Seriously injured patients who didn't get transportation were forced to walk to the border, and the rest were resigned to staying there waiting to die without help from anyone.

" Someone well rooted in heartlessness would support this particular scene as ‚Äúa necessary defense for what Hamas did‚Äù, and they‚Äôd illuminate the fact they know nothing of the situation other than their hatred for others who aren‚Äôt them or their loved ones, and their willingness to participate in the Genocide of a people they‚Äôre too ignorant to understand or empathize with."
" I imagine how barbaric and inhumane Israel's behavior was in that hospital at that time.  Seriously injured patients who didn't get transportation were forced to walk to the border, and the rest were resigned to staying there waiting to die without help from anyone.  Some of the paramedics were detained because they were suspected of knowing about Hamas' presence.  and.. it feels like the hospital and the dying patients in it will be destroyed by being rocketed from above or hit by surrounding tanks at the same time."

 Why UN stood for to support genocide..shame .why you not take any initiation
 Continue to PRAY for the Palistinians and the Jewish brethren who stand against their leaders and their genocide agenda on these defenceless people. It has NOTHING TO DO WITH HAMAS but their GENOCIDAL CAMPAIGN. THIS IS THE TRUE EVIDENCE. MAY ELOHIM BRING HIS JUDGEMENT ON THEM FOR THE EVIL THEY HAVE DONE.
 I'm worried about those who can't walk or move outside the hospital? Do they all expect to get bombed and killed inside the hospital? The scene of the boy crying among the crowd of refugees is really hurting and painful to watch. Is this killing field possible in the 21st century?
 So terrible. Human beings should it be treated this way
" The situation went beyond the limits from the beginning. HAMAS "" urgently needs to stop using civilians""  to stop the war"
" ABSOLUTELY  HORRIBLE  SITUATION  ,  what else can they do"

 god bless this is people
" I can only imagine what terrible things the IDF is going to do with those bodies, patients, medics and babies. This has to stop now!"
 The U.S. has mostly sided with Israel when they are accused of atrocities over the years at the UN. The rules should change. Majority should rule.  The U.S. government is not acting in their citizens‚Äô interest.
 I blame the American government and I am American. If our government had a spine and an ounce of courage we would condemn this and urge Israel to stop using the attack and hostage taking as a pretext to occupy this territory and commit genocide. Not condemning this is anti-Semitic and cheapens the victims of the Holocaust. Such cowards!

" It is very important to hold leaders like Netanyahu accountable for their actions, just like the accountability seen with Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá of Serbia and his team. This would undoubtedly set a powerful precedent for future war criminals and give moderate people within Israel a chance at peace. The collective punishment of Palestinian civilians under Netanyahu's leadership constitutes a crime in itself."

" Too confusing report, according to this person talking, the IDF instructed to vacate the hospital in an hour . But then same spokesman said that some hospital staff are allowed to stay with the patients. Body search for potential combatant leaving the hospital is fair since the Israelis found weapons and communication gadgets inside the hospital."
 Ya Allah rahem
 Ya Allah how israel cruel people playing games using name of Hamas to oppresse innocent people of Palestine
" Yes ‚Äì the cost of waging war has a very high price ‚Äì usually it is the young innocents that pay the price that the adults that support and work with Hamas do not consider. Now ‚Äì they cry foul ‚Äì that Israel is to blame ‚Äì but it is you that work and support Hamas that are 100% to blame. The lives of the infants and children lost are due to Palestinian support of Hamas and your refusal to evacuate when told to do so. When you attack Israel there will always be a heavy cost, so keep that in mind next time you consider attacking Jewish people!"
" IT IS THE HAMAS FAULT , LOOK WHAT THEY'VE DONE!! PRAYING PRAYING"
 How horrible can a person get
 Hamas should not be given free access to use the hospital for military purpose in the first place. The discovery of killed hostages at the hospital premises indicates the presence of Hamas there.

 Hamas health ministry is controlled  by Hamas govt. The  Hospital Director is the employee of Hamas govt. Therefore evacuate patients to safety can be complicated and may  encounter many resistance from hospital staff rather than cooperation  to bring every patient to safety. Help has come to their doorsteps but the only effort demonstrated  by hospital director is to  magnify their dire  conditions in order to gain sympathy from WHO and international community. Help came but still a stream of  continuous complaining from director.
" They really mean ir, they think we are animals."
 Another crime.
 Iran-backed Hamas have   created all these situations.
 IDF soldiers are one of the best military in the world
 What a world are we live in
 If Israel has been to  the hospital searched it couldn't find any tunnels no command centre no stock piles of weapons. So why do they have to leave.
 Great reporting
 I'll never see my own country the same again.
 Some evil people told me Arab nations have a diplomacy in thier not intervening. No this isnt diplomacy. This is poor cowardice. There is no other time than real w@r with the oppressor than now.... My heart bleeds and my sickness aggravated seeing the suffering of Palestinians every single day... This is terribly sad
 So painful
 Israeli people must be proud that this going on.
 The Director speaks as a Hamas reporter not as an independent person.
 Why are they taking the dead out of the grave?!
 Where is the justice of United Nation? Where are the countries that talk about human rights? Why is Israel not being declared a terrorist country now? This is cruelty and they are very cruel. Our belief and faith is that the best decision will be made by Allah. InshaAllah

 Sad...
 After seeing weapons and explosive found in hospitals throughout Gaza and then the Israeli forces still brought in generators and fuel to power the hospital.  Storing weapons in a hospital is a larger crime
 This is coming from a person that is over a hospital with bombs on the inside

 I don‚Äôt understand why western media can‚Äôt see this.???
 Answer the cctv showing medical staff waiting for Hamas bringing hostages into Al Shifa then telling them which room to use - your staff knew they were coming. Your hospital was complicit
 Its a war. Proven that the enemy had been using that hospital as some sort of base at the very least.

 This is totally shame on isreal
 The Isreali's also want to know what will become of their families that are being held hostage?
 This is not the normal situation how can you be like ice.  ???
 Hostages are in the tunnels under the hospital.
 Sure Israel had to interrogate people in the hospital because they were dressing up like they were workers from the hospital. They could‚Äôve been lying that they were sick or they had an injury and they very well could‚Äôve been Hamas. I understand that they had to interrogate everybody.

 Hamas attacks without mercy. And then Isreal responds without mercy. Who's in the right?
 So how come that there are a lot of weapons of evil hamas inside the hospital
 The ONU as an International organization are not recognize on Gaza naow?
 Someone plays games with humans.
 Free the hostages
 Aljassira You biassed joke
 Do you ever just listen to something and you can just hear the thick layer of bullshit that it is smeared with
 They are all HAMAS fighter medics
 I donno why PPL are remaining still silent....can't anyone see wats happening around us....pls pls do something...leave the religion they are too humans
" It is not for Biden to decide who shall govern Gaza,it is for the Palestinians of Gaza to decide who will control Gaza."
 His heart was breaking as he sends weapons to the Israeli government
 He is complicit in this genocide
" t‚Äôs not  a matching game to win or lose. It‚Äôs about  Justice, humanity, human rights and freedom from confiscation with force, authority and injustice. They have right to get their own home country back and live peacefully in their own land, home and  having their own government, like other nations do."
" He doesn't have the right to say, Palestinians will decide their own future, the problem is Israel occupation."
 Biden and non of the western hypocrites should have any say who governs Gaza
" I had hope for Abbas, but not anymore. He's against a ceasefire? My God, who has paid him off to allow the continued slaughter of the innocent in Gaza. How horrible and what an awful man. No excuse is good enough for that stand. As Gaza sits in ruins, covered in the dead and dying. He's worried about Hamas and their pathetic weapons. Hamas leaders aren't even in Gaza. What am I not seeing or understanding? Has the world gone insane or have I?"

" what a great job Baiden  did here , he is a Bollywood actor , acting very well,  one day come for  us,  wait and see what we have doing in that time ,"
 You can't take his word.
 Dont think joe is going to have a say so. Getting booted out of the region but not just yet has to suffer a bit first
 America should be charged for Israeli culpability.
 He doesn‚Äôt really have any say in the matter. He‚Äôs just acting like a lapdog for the Israelis and his comments about the Palestinians is no better than ‚Äòthoughts and prayers.‚Äô Very disappointing in his disgraceful sucking up to Israel.
 This is not democracy. Let the Palestinians decide.
 While Netanyahu wants Gaza to be under constant vigil of his security forces. Police state in other words.
" I was going to vote for Biden next November, but his unwavering support for genocide has changed my mind."

 We need President Sarkozy and President Obama to remind Biden tht Natatahu is a liar again and again.
 And who is Biden to instruct what other countries should do?
 Very good news from Biden...lets hope it becomes reality.
 Ultimate they will run away and they will leave alone when they lose a lot of arms and political issues and as well ficial
 This man is so old he needs to retire he absolutely doesn‚Äôt know what he is saying‚Ä¶ his two faced. He will be held accountable for all this‚Ä¶
" There was supposed to be a connector road b/w the WB and GS ACCORDING TO OSLO, a road which Israel never allowed. A two-state solution was based on the idea that Israel would STOP BUILDING SETTLEMENTS back in the early 90s, which Israel never has done. Does anyone think that Israel will ever agree to any sort of viable two-state solution, or that there is even land left to create a Palestinian state separate form Israel? ....come on...."
" How the F*** is your heart breaking if you send more weapons to occupation.  You cant even remember what happen a minute ago, time for young people to take over the governments,  these old people cant think anymore, they do stuff to ensure they have a retirement fund waiting."

" People shouting ""Free Palestine"" are the ones who doesn't want a Untied Government in Palestine"

 Turkey üáπüá∑ should govern Palestine
 Not up to him to say what Palestine should or shouldn't do when he is complicit in war crimes against them.
" Words no action rhetoric, action speak louder than words."
" Shame, shame on us and UN shame."
 But does he even remember what he says after a minute?

" What is the point of talking about the far future if even there is Palestinians left there?? Just want to divert about the on going genocide and ethnic cleansing Isharamreal campaign. This talk should be talk when the ceasefire happen, not right now."
" After the failures of Iraq & Afghanistan, the U.S. & Israel decided to pick a fight with a much smaller weaker opponent. In about 2 months they will find out whether that assumption is true."
 He is giving false hope.
" No, to external dictatirship"
" With what the spring is disturbed and the spring is poisoned,"
 Seems like  west Bank authority is very obedient to US. Palestinians should decide Who will govern them.
 palastine
" I agree with Biden, only this time when he say's Palastine should have it's own state, but i do not believe he means it, we will see"
 Similar to Israel we knew the religion of Buddhism for over more than 2500 years preached by Lord Buddha who born at dambadiva / lumbini in india where the ancient Buddhist temple is situated but the vicinity of the temple is owned by people of Hindu religion here the question arises Buddhist from Korea Japan China thailan can invade over dambadiva/india demanding that where the Buddha's ancient temple is situated ?
 Let's start fund raising program for Palestinian infants and children
 Abbas doesn‚Äôt even govern the West Bank. What a facade
 Are they going to come to govern  the rubles of Gaza?
 Tell Biden there isn't going be any left  and he is talking about after
" It is not time talk about what will happen in the future, but  the present to stop the genocide."

 This means that the west bank  leader sold out the revolution
 Good the Palestinian people need one government should they can get statehood easier than after that they can deal with the internal politics
 Why Palestinian affair need US to intervene? Hamas is elected by Palestinian by Democratic process. Why US now don't respect Democracy?
" Go home Mr Baiden, have a rest."
 I was at a retirement seminar and the speaker spoke on how he quit his job after he made well over
 Did he ask permission from his friend?

 Who is Biden to decide this?
" People of the world dont believe authority will bring new equal rights just a continuation of apartheid system.pallastinian authority could bring much needed emediate peace.three countries within in israel with protected status and passports with return flights to these shrunk homelands,so international rebuilding with arab/european can be  state free without instability pressurising imigration.i call for GAZARABIA,MID BANK,HOLYC passports with return flights and rights"
" I find the comment ""as we strive for peace.. "" to be a highly cynical joke coming from the only party who can do something about this, but won't. FJB"
 WHO ARE YOU TO TELL OTHER NATIONS THAT WHO SHOULD GOVERN THEM?
" Mr President,  you can't even bring ceasefire to current conflict in GAZA how can you bring two state solution."
 Who are you to decide on it?
" That's for the Palestinian people to decide not joe biden who left the chatroom long time a go, joe can't even decide what goes in his mouth."

 Please dont blurr the images.
 While he supplies military aid to Israel. You must be joking.
 US is sheds crocodile tears
 Need impose the 1967 borders. If not this crisis will not stop.

 Luckily we get Trump back next year
 This guy is no statesman. Wrong on everything.
 Liar !
 He lie
 Senile old bloke
 Too little too late brandon
 Abass is hamas and they are both bigs!
 Such a hypocrite give weapons with one hand to Israel and give aid with the other hand to Palestinians
 Gaza citizens to decide who will rule them.
" Palestinian state , or nothing."
 He probably gets a lot of chirldren from there so doesnt want the conflict to end.
 Not going to happen!
 If there is a Palestinian state then there should be an election where all parties ca  participate.  This will help get out the corrupt parties from governing.   Definitely not Mohamoud Abbas
 Its cute. But how much money did you and jill received from kews and izrel for this holocaus of Palestine.
 Arab country is America pet dog
 Hamas does not have legitimacy anymore.
 BIDEN. ? ...KKKK
 i live in the US and now i know i live in the dumbest country ever

 Pretty disgusting that the terrorists are trying to convince the innocent to remain in place So they can hide among them/use them as shields. Honestly haven't seen something so cowardly in a long time.
 Heartbreaking for the innocent civilians and children
 No innocent person should have to experience this no matter who you are or where your from
 My heart breaks for the suffering children...
" I am just speechless at that last scene of the father carrying his dead daughter. there is nothing to be said really. No matter how hard you try to justify these bombings, you are wrong."
" If this is not a crime against humanity, what is?"
 Human nature at its very worst is being played out before the eyes of the world. Heartbreaking.
" In the shadow of conflict, it's crucial to remember our shared humanity. War, with its devastation, doesn't discern between cultures, beliefs, or borders. It impacts the young and old, rich and poor alike. As global citizens, it's our collective responsibility to advocate for peace, understanding, and unity. We must remember that every act of violence ripples through generations, leaving lasting scars. But with empathy, dialogue, and an unwavering commitment to harmony, we can mend these rifts. Let us stand together, transcending divisions, to champion a world where love overcomes hate, where acceptance replaces prejudice, and where peace is the legacy we bequeath to our children. The dream of a war-free world starts with each of us."
 Rationalising the killing of children and innocent people altogether is just SICK. It just proves how many psychopaths there are out there in this world. Prayers and thoughts go to all of these innocent people.
 It's horrible how many innocent people have been killed because of this conflict.
 Oh my God. Very very sad for those innocent children . My heart breaks for all those innocent people.
 They fight over the land but destroy the same land. I cannot even comprehend how they justify this in their minds. That place is cursed not holy.
 They want their enemies to play by the rules.. But they don't follow the rules
" The situation in the Middle East is undeniably complex, and it is essential to recognize that there are no easy answers to the ongoing conflicts. The recent attacks from Hamas, targeting civilian areas in Israel, must be unequivocally condemned. Such actions only serve to escalate tensions and endanger innocent lives."
" The term ""crime against humanity"" is thrown around a lot, but rarely has it been so fitting than to describe what Hamas did a week ago."
 The war between nations always ends up harming the ordinary people in the end.
 i struggle to find the words that can explain such immoral acts of violence. my heart bleeds for the loss of all the innocent lives in this conflict.
 When you lash out with violence you get violence in return and it never ends well
" When you attack someone, why do you not expect repercussions?"
 Soo painful to see the victims suffer on both sides

" Telling those people not to leave is disgusting.. they are using them as shields, that can be the only reason they would say that."
 The father at the end made me shed tears. This madness needs to stop.
 My heart cries blood for the world's state . When will we understand we all deserve the right to live . This pain and suffering that is caused because we can't come to terms with the fact that no human being has ownership to this planet.  We are guest of mother earth and yet we continue to destroy our mother earth with our selfish destructive lifestyle.  Humans if you can't learn to empathize with one another then  your just loading the barrel of self genocide... may peace find its way to this world because hate has consumed us all ...
" For those that don‚Äôt feel for these people and condone it, may you rot in your hate!"
 It's so confusing that media inside Gaza is not focusing anymore on the whereabouts of the hostages and their captors.

 Never would you be justified in cutting off water on 1 million people.
 It's literally insane to see rockets coming out of dense residential blocks. How can Hamas ask Israel to hit their fighters while using civilians as shields?
 How can someone smash your home up and then complain when you go around and smash everything they own
" The suffering of civilians, regardless of their nationality, is a tragic consequence of conflict, emphasizing the urgent need for a diplomatic and peaceful resolution to ensure the well-being and safety of all people in the region."
 'How dare you fire rocets at us. Its a crime against humanity' whilst hiding behind hostages and civilians and also firing rocets.

" I always hate the war irony, its instigated by few people from participating nations,the citizens suffer and you'll hear people decrying war crimes.War is not a game, stop war to avert all consequences, if you cannot cease,bear the consequences. The sad part for me is that the instigators don't directly suffer the effects, only innocent citizens"
 The poor innocent people and children will suffer for this what a disgrace give them back their land and live in peace
" It's very, very, very sad for the civilians on both sides.  May God hears their prayers"
" Nothing makes me feel quite as helpless and cynical as this conflict, and I'm just a casual observer far away."
" Recognize our common humanity. Embrace each other. Reject extremism and terror on all sides and in all forms. Compromise, love, and learn how to peacefully share the sandbox with your brothers and sisters- for the good of all."
" Just question,"
 Who will blame who ?One can never understand horrible things that humans do.
 May God judge both sides harshly in heaven - the only innocents are the families who died on BOTH sides. I pray God makes both sides hold hands and call each other brother in death.
 Odd how the Palestinians don't blame in the least their government ... for all the crimes it has committed and brought on to it's people!
" It grieves me to see the loss of many Palestinian lives, encompassing men, women, and children who aspire to peace. Hamas's misjudgment has inflicted a toll on the Palestinian people. Nevertheless, I continue to hold hope that a day will come when peace is realized between Israel and Palestine."
 I can't imagine what     thehostages are going through. Pure evil. All this destruction is taking place in a supposedly advanced society.
 What can be said innocent people are suffering on both sides of this crisis. The children break my heart the most. And Hamas is to blame for it because they started this by attacking Israel first. Israel is just answering back shot for shot for what Hamas did.
 I cry for humanity. Oh God please help us .

 My respect to most of people that comment ‚Äú for every action there is reactions‚Äù they cheered & now victims card ; ALWAYS
 It‚Äôs always the people in power who are the most sick and inhuman but they fight and never die
" I'm starting to think its the whole place that's cursed. Ever since ancient history, whoever settles there have been killing each other, regardless of the empire, race, ethnicity, or religion. Its as if there's something in that place that's feeding off of the conflicts throughout history."
" War is ugly, and those who suffer most are women and children. This chills me to my bones."
 its not accusations its documented and has been the last 50 years at least
" Before Israel attacked Gaza, Civilians were told to move to the South but Hamas wanted them to stay and used them as human shield. On the other Russia didn't give warnings to Ukrainians and attack civilians"
 Wars may have rules...But I have never seen anyone actually follow them. Conflicts maybe.
 The reporter has been keeping his eyes open on these unfolding events for sure
" May those who died, died a martyr of the faith.when the world left them to live and die in utter strife, may they find paradise in the hereafter. When evil has reached its peak, good shall rise to balance nature.may the mahdi rise and defend the faith.let the jinns rise on the ashes they created,  let the prophecies be fulfilled as it's due.let justice reign once again.may the Ummah stand strong for in these times we need you for our hearts aches for our Palestinian brothers and sisters.may the heavens hear our cry and the wrong be righted."
 All my prayers goes to the Victim that dies and injured.
 The blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
" You can't ask for pity and condemn your opponent after your own kind did the same. In simple terms, you can't throw a surprise punch and complain when your opponent hits you back with ten."

" Both sides use cruelty, that's a fact no matter who has started it because both sides have their reason to do so. There are no words to describe the pain of the bereaved families. May the lost souls rest in peace."
 This is horrible. How and why is everybody letting this happen?
" The children are always ours, every single one of them, all over the globe; and I am beginning to suspect that whoever is incapable of recognizing this may be incapable of morality."
 Someone Please resolve the issue
 There is no point by Acusing someone for things that you do as well... Its just karma.
" People should understand the distinction between authorities and normal citizens. Why do some people say, 'Gaza people are no different than Hamas terrorists‚Äô ?Authorities who hold power often deceive and manipulate normal citizens, even in Western countries.

" Humanity has lost a grip on life and what's normal. Mentally, something has gone very wrong in the world."
" There exists an abundance of occurences of atrocities that hold significant evidentiary value, so numerous as to border on the absurd to ignore, this will go down in the ark of history as a moral stain on the collective conscious of the world"
 I can't watch any more of this. It's just too heartbreaking.  Any war is a crime against humanity.  You can't trust any politician; they have their own agenda.  They do not have the best interests of the population in mind when they wage war.   Who wants war?  Nobody!  I can't believe this is still going on.  Bring the end to the suffering.
 You gotta question yourself if you think killing civilians & children‚Äôs is ok & try to justify it. How about you give these civilians you call terrorist their land back or at least give them citizenship & equal rights instead of caging 2 mill people in small space & now ask them to evacuate half of it so you can take that land also. What difference than the Nazis that make you?
 I hope something better awaits the child. One world One love
" Honestly the UN gets no love and I think what they stand for is honourable. I know they have a terrible track record for the most part, but I‚Äôm pretty sure they are the only thing that stands in the way of regional powers or superpowers from going full ape on each other at will. I know that geopolitical tensions are high lately, but I still think the world is far away from a global war. The interdependence / complexity of war nowadays helps increase indecision and the chance of a diplomatic solution."
 Humanity!!! Eish my heart is with all of you who have lost loved ones in this. And that last clip of a man carrying his own dead daughter leaves me with no words.
 Very sad human loss on both the sides
 Israel has given a clear warning.  Civilians can protect their families by moving.  It is heart breaking but necessary to move.
 Thats rich considering the things they did were exactly that lol.
" Regarding the real reason why Palestinians aren't condemning it's governments actions, I have a question. Do the Palestinians under Hamas really have freedom of speech? I mean, we've seen what happens to Russians whenever they speak out against their special military operation. Hamas is already using its' population as human shields, and I don't believe they would treat them more kindly if they spoke up against them."

 Innocent people are being sacrificed because of this war. These sacrifices must be stopped.
 Why did this news report make no mention of the Hamas being the attackers and the Palestinians and Israelis the victims? Poor reporting. I'm glad you showed the trauma they are going through but should have brought home the point of the cruelty of the terrorist.
 This is heartbreaking.  Nobody wins a war and it solves nothing.  This is an act of revenge and nothing will come of it. Just death and destruction.  These people have been fighting forever and they will continue to fight because they're not capable of rational thinking.
 The sorrow that Hamas has caused is heartbreaking. I pray this ends soon.

 This reporter is an eye witness
 I can't believe they're talking about war crimes what about all those crimes they committed when they invaded Israel and Israel did not start this war they didn't want it
 I can't help but wonder how much more this would continue if the Western media refused to air the video footage or statements of either side.
 The only differences between us and all of the generations that came before us is that we have more advanced technologies. War and murder is as old as humans itself.

 How do you stop Hamas members from moving south? And how do you recognize a Hamas member between the citizens left behind. This is an impossible task for the IDF. They can only try to find as much tunnels as possible and destroy those.
 War is an umbrella term for a collection of atrocities commited in the name of some goal.
" Just consider this, The present Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said that the greatest single mistake of the Palestinian Arab delegates was to refuse the offer of an independent State which was offered to them in 1947 by the UN, this newly formed State would have been in areas of old Palestine that are now referred to as the disputed territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip In the Camp David agreements (in the 1970s)held in the USA, Israel offered the Palestinians a State in these disputed territories. Again in the Oslo accords (in around 1993) the Palestinians were offered an independent state in the disputed territories. Many times over the Israeli Government has offered the Palestinian representatives an Independent State"
" People think just because God says pray for Israel, that we condemn anyone they have conflict with. The actions of terrorists does not justify killing innocent people. No one wins in war. No one is right in war. I pray for everyone involved in this war. We serve God in Spirit and truth. Not by a blind rally to support one side. We need to look at what's really going on.

" This is the sad reality of terrorism. Had HAMAS did not massacre the   civilians of Israel then there is no reason for Israel  to retaliate to protect their people.  Very sad to see that when Israel was under attacked and videos of carnage seen. Palestinians were seen rejoicing all across the globe.. What about the lives lost. Eldely,  young people, mothers, parents children and babies. HAMAS should solely be blamed for all this. God be merciful on all the people of the earth."

 Civilians on both sides should bring down the governments which are eager to war rather than to find a peace solution.

" The U.N. tells both sides to protect civilians. Since when has Hamas (Hezbollah, Iran, Syria or ISIS) ever cared about civilians, whether they be Israeli, Palestinians or otherwise?"
" The problem being once Hamas did such depraved things in Israel they must of expected the gates of hell too open. Once Hamas  had inflicted such carnage in Israel you can't shout crimes  against humanity , The sad thing on both sides its the innocent population  that lose their lives."
 Did we see Gaza protesting Hamas before the attack? If they truly did not like or support Hamas wouldn‚Äôt there have been some type of retaliation by Gaza civilians or at least someone would have turned to Israel and gave them the information they needed to defend themselves before the attack? Someone had to know something somewhere and not one person outed Hamas just seems like civilians who hated a terrorist organization or didn‚Äôt support them wouldn‚Äôt usually let them occupy their cities very long they would at least reach out to another country for some support or try to I don‚Äôt recall Gaza doing anything about Hamas it‚Äôs ‚Äúeye for a eye‚Äù !
" This outbreak of violence is another episode in the history of these lands. A history that has the Palestinians and Jews diametrically opposed to each other. Gaza is an open prison without guards that is operated by a gang called Hamas and funded by outside criminal interests. The division between these peoples has created the conditions for this violence and will go on, even after Gaza is taken and Hamas is destroyed unless a major path to a peaceful settlement within one sate is agreed. The West's policy in the Middle East, so keenly bound around Israel, has been a major factor in this situation developing."

Because of this event, millions will roam the land of the living, not knowing how to cross-over to the next life. It will take years, decades or even the end of time before their souls will be at peace. Both sides were at wrong and both sides had innocent lives taken.

From what I‚Äôve heard and seen, I feel incredibly sorry for the families of the civilian casualties who have been killed and injured, and I also feel even more sorry for the dead as well as the injured.

 According to the Beeb Palestinians are unable to get south because of the lack of transport.  So refugees can walk across Europe but in Gaza they can't walk 20km.  Similarly they can bust through every imaginable type of border fence but can't get over the one that separates Egypt from Gaza.
" I NEVER hear any one from gaza saying they are sorry for killing men, women and children nor that it was wrong or that they will return the hostages.  They never ask for peace, they just cry about how bad things are for them.  They don't say that they should have take more hostages instead of killing all those people."

" Germans made the same mistake before Stalingrad - by bombing the city before a ground offensive, the ruins created a great defensive resource for the Red Army and rendered it difficult for the German 6th Army to make progress. Israel will do wipe out Hamas and the historical antecedent may not be reflected but at least now it looks like it might well materialise. Obviously Israel did not want to rush here - it stayed close to the US and eyed off Iran."
" ""Accuse""? very telling. Not surprised though."
" Ironically, non of them are asking or making a plea to hamas to release the hostages and end this madness."
" One thing I find strange, is I have not heard 1 Gazan mention or blame Hamas. It's understandable why the majority wouldn't, but in an area of 2 million people, you would think there would be somebody in there who would say something along the lines of 'Hamas say they fight for our freedom but they fight for our destruction'. Not saying I believe in this line of thinking, I just find it extremely strange that every single person I have seen has only blamed Israel and never mentioned Hamas."
" It is heartbreaking for citizens on both sides, but this is what hatred breeds. Hamas has brought this on their own people but of course their people will be told a different story. They probably don't even know Hamas attacked and slaughtered 1000 Israelis. If they did know, what did they think the response would be? Please don't kill us again, or retribution?"

 Heartbreaking.
 Since the BBC does not want to label Hamas 'terrorist' in order to stay neutral I think that in order to be consistent we should label 'war crimes' as 'unpleasant events'.
" Crimes against humanity huh. Like murdering unarmed civilians running away in a music festival, going door to door and shooting while families and raping women and beheading people including infants, oh and also apparently burning them as well. I guess the video that shows Shani Louk in her underwear facedown with her leg in a very uncomfortable normal position in the back of a pickup truck while people were spitting on her (at the time thought to be dead body) is humane."
 For every terrorist killed 100 innocent people are killed with that one terrorist but it cant be helped theres no way to seperate them during airstrikes but gaza are also the ones that put hamas in power so they will have to share their fate
 I can't be the only one who wishes for both sides to lose. Peace is an impossibility when dealing with fanatics.

 In order to have rules you need someone enforcing them. Who enforces rules in a war?
" When we were bombed by the Germans, we had to retaliate with our own bombing raids in Germany. Unfortunately, that involved killing lots of civilians. This is the nature of war. You could ask why the German population allowed the Nazis to control them. You could also ask why the Palestinians have allowed terrorists to control them as well..."
" We should remember that Hamas came into existence with encouragement and ficial support of Israel as they wanted to create a religious counterweight to the secular and left oriented leadership of the Palestinian political organisations at that time. Although this cunning plan has succeeded more than any Israelis reasonably wished for, Hamas has as intended helped Israel in killing all peace attempts."
" Israel has been commiting crimes against humanity for a long time, but gotta be honest, Hamas is the one doing it this time, for once it seems Israel is trying to have a heart and let the Palestinians leave Gaza so they are safe, but Hamas isn't letting them leave, I feel like the Palestinians should probably be blaming Hamas right now as they are using the civilians as human shields, the Palestinian people must really regret electing Hamas now, I'm heartbroken for all the civilians who have to deal with this, both the Israeli and Palestinians."
 why people believe in god but don't believe in kindness and humanity
 Absolutely war crimes
 Crimes against humanity you said ?

 Palestinians are in our prayers. May Hamas and Israeli leaders be held accountable.

" ""break the back of HAMAS by any means possible"""
 I bet Jeremy Bowen engineered this
" If even war has "" rules "", who decides what the rules are for each combatant, when one is a terrorist organization dedicated to your destruction.  Hamas may have the right to make claims of crimes against humanity but we have the right to believe them false and many know what they have been and are capable of."

" Is it just me, or does it seem that the majority of the mainstream media kinda blame Israel for this?  I'm getting a bit of an anti-Semitic vibe from more than some of these ""reporters""."
 hahaha the irony... flatten Gaza!!!!
 Stay strong Palestinians. Greetings from Serbia.
" a week ago they were spitting and dancing on naked dead bodies and celebrating death. its amazing, its like they have no moral compass what so ever. I'm starting to think they are truly insane."
 Who ever advised Hamas leaders to attack Israel took them for a fool.
 So heartbreaking. What did Hamas expect when they attacked innocent people and are holding hostages. Palestinian need to hold Hamas accountable.
" Leaflets thrown over Gaza at a time like this can be considered state sponsored terror, without bombs."
" If you're not careful, the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing."
 don't start anything you can't finish
 Why can‚Äôt everyone live life and get along‚Ä¶why such terrorists‚Ä¶what do they expect to get on judgement day‚Ä¶these actions are always bad for the civilians of both sides & Never has good outcomes. Terrorists just started so much senseless loss of life.
 I feel terrible for everyone dealing with this. I would feel more grief for the Palestinians if they would stand up and condem Hamas but they don‚Äôt. Egypt doesn‚Äôt even want them in their country. Extremism on both sides needs to end.

 ‚ÄúWe can forgive the Arabs for killing our children. We cannot forgive them for forcing us to kill their children. We will only have peace with the Arabs when they love their children more than they hate us‚Äù
 But them beheading people and burning them is not???
 There's one thing i truly dont understand Why are their brotherhood neighbors aren't taking them in? Why slam the doors on your people? The one you urge to go to war but when vulnerable nothing?!?!?
" Not a single report or interview I've seen where a Palestinian places any accountability for this on Hamas.  Not a single Palestinian feeling remorse for the deaths of the innocent Israelis.  Meanwhile, the world is expected to hold Israel accountable for their response and support all the innocent Palestinians.  Palestine/Israel are two sides of the same mirror in this conflict.  Israel needs to find more empathy for non-radical civilian Palestinians, and Palestinians need to reject Hamas and hold them to account for what befell both countries."
" May Allah help Gaza üáµüá∏ I wish and PRAY for Palestine only the best, and I'm sure it will get its land back no doubts üáµüá∏üáµüá∏"
 So? The conflict is escalating! Nobody knows when it will stop!
" Talk about ""The pot calling the kettle black"".  Kind of like the damacrats, do something evil, and turn it around when it happens to them."
" They pray to the same God, ``Suffer your enemies,'' but they should ask God for each other's happiness."
" ""Wars have rules.."" Not according to YOUR government. They do not abide by those rules. I do not understand how Palestinians expect to get the benefit of the rules, while following none of them. There is no difference between the Palestinians and Hamas. Hamas is Gaza and Gaza is Hamas and Hamas is Palestine. Palestinians chose Hamas as their government. As much as the USA is responsible for who they elect, Palestine is too. They brought this destruction, pain and suffering on themselves. I have very little sympathy for them."
" All this can be pinned on religion. Crazy how a concept called religion can caused so much death to the human race. Everyone bleed the same red blood, enjoy pleasure such food, entertainment etc but why can't people just put aside their difference and live in harmony. Personally I think it is stupid to die for a belief, if only the world work together and see past color, race and religion"
 I feel so shame to be a human right now .I can't help but I pray for you Gaza .Usrael isn't different than Russia now I'm sure about it.
" ""Even war has rules."""
 Religion is a curse for humanity. When people respect other beings as a part of their own then there will be peace and peace is the only way forward. We are living in a modern world were religion do not have to come in any form or shape.
 ‚ÄúMay I eat the baa?‚Äù
 When you start war don't expect mercy
" This is the repercussions of having generations of Palestinians suppressed, this is the repercussions of dictatorship on both sides, protect the children that is all, allow the children and mothers to get out safely."
" On one hand, the Palestinian ambassador says it amounts to ethic cleansing... and on the other hand Hamas calls the evacuation warning a bluff"
 Free Palestine
" why do people in this world seem to care about a group but not humanity value that broke by a group who disturbed and killed children, women and men who have different perspective about their religion?????"
 Strong support Palestine !
" Praying that humanity recognizes that we are all one. We all have the right to life and freedom. The problem will not be solved by being a supporter of one side or the other, because then there will always be separation and hatred. We have to support unity between people from all regions and be grateful for the miracle of life. The war must be against the evil that is perpetuating among human beings. May everyone do their part in removing hate and prejudice from their lives and may we move together toward light, peace and harmony. Namaste!"
 Those explosions are so pretty
 Hypocrisy is the main professional quality of modern journalism
" War 1 rule, whatever you to the enemy you can expect that back. If there were any rules Hamas broke them first."
 And they have a right to do so. No-one can starve out 1m people. It is inhumane.
 religion leads to fear. governments use fear to commit crimes. on the end the people suffer.
 Disgusting to see the innocent civilians and casualty on both sides. How long will it go on like this
 And Israel is comprised by a lot of descendants of Holocaust victims. You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd be some of the most non violent and compassionate people.
" If they were told a hurricane or wild fire was 24 hours away, they would evacuate. A 24 hour warning is more than Hamas has ever offered. The Palestinians elected and re-elected Hamas. Their actions are on behalf of the Palestinians. If they don't support Hamas, walk south."
" How can you call others evil or terrorist when you're doing the same, killing civilians."
 I honestly thought we were too advanced for this. Generations will look back on us as  embarrassments. I hope the 2100s are able to rid the world of religions and have a more sensible society.
 Free occupation

 this is incrediblely sad and mind boggling
" Thank you Israel for doing what we in the West feel as an appropriate response. We have suffered terrorist attacks time and time again, and we are told ""NO, DON'T INCITE VIOLENCE"" and ""DON'T LOOK BACK IN ANGER."" God bless you Israel. Strike true."
 People keep stating that Gaza is 50% children. It‚Äôs heartbreaking that Hamas would behead Israeli children and do this to the children of their own people.
" they start with 5000 rockets, countered, and then ask for help. im not stupid."
" Hamas considers ""Palestinians"" to be nothing but meat shields for their insane bloodlust against all infidels. For a moment, I feel sorry for innocent ‚ÄúPalestinians.‚Äù  Then I remember who and what they really are, have done, and will continue to do, and my sympathy vanishes."
 What do you say we should  keep quiet when our innocent  children  and family  attacked¬ø?
 Actions have consequences
 Genesis 4:9
" When Hamas and his allies were happy yesterday, they are crying today"
 Just hand the hostages back.
 It is getting harder to see the 'good-guys' in this whole mess. 'Good-guys' don't kill kids.
 üáµüá∏üáµüá∏
 How do you call what hamas did to Israel?
 I strongly condemned the brutal attack on Israel by Hamas but I stand with and support Palestinians because they have long been oppressed and their land encroached by force by Israelites Jews... I pray and hope that God protect and shield innocent civilians from their aggressors
 All young children should be able to exit war zones without a passport and then properly sheltered far away from the fighting for as long as the war lasts. The UN should provide this.
" ""Crime against humanity"" while Palestinians paragliders went in attacking innocent unarmed people from age of 16 to 30 at the festival.. Ye, that act is not punishable at all. No wonder few countries stands aside Israel now just because of that act. War is a crime itself. There is a saying ""Throw a cup on the rock and the cup breaks, but throw a rock onto the cup, and cup breaks"" in this case, people are just cups among rocks."
 God Bless Israel and may they defeat the evil in totality!
 This made me cry
 It's a spiritual battle. The true owner of that land will come back for it. The liars that claim that their Jews will never take that land. Pray for Jerusalem's peace and peace for his people and his children.

" It's silly to say that they're committing crimes against humanity, as there are no humans in the G"
" El-Azhar the most prestigious Islamic university in Egypt, top cleric Ahmed El-tyb said in a statement after the Hamas Attacks; that this act gave our feeble bodies new soul after years of stale and stagt times - - Not a word about the victims, clearly they want jihad to continue no peace in Izlam."
" The hard truth is they do all this suffering to themselves. I don't think anybody with some sense left can take the Palestinians seriously in 2023 anymore. Those days are over. Their Hamas terrorists have killed about 1,300 innocent Israelis in a very inhumane way. And we have all seen the videos of the attack!"
 WTF did Hamas think was going to happen? Tea and cake talks over talks?
 Now the Palestinians realized there's something called Humanity
 It has returned.
" When people in Ukraine fight for their land, they're called brave freedom fighters. But when folks in Palestine do the same thing, even though they don't have as many weapons, the western media call them ""terrorists""."
 This is war. Retaliation comes. WHO started this war
" The awful things that Hamas is doing to these poor Palestinians. Hamas can ease their pain by releasing its hostages. If it will not do this, then it can expect more pain."
 This people commit catastrophe and then hide under innocent civilian shells.
 Oh no ! Not the consequences of my own actions
 Israel sure knows how to make itself popular in the region.
" The BBC must ensure accurate reporting by correctly identifying Hamas as a terrorist organization. It is important to attribute war crimes to acts such as beheadings, murdering civilians, and parading female corpses in Gaza. Israel's restraint with the Palestinians is commendable, and the notion of a victim card is no longer accepted."
" How about bringing back the issue about who started the mess in the Middle East? The British mission created this conflict. Prisons and barracks of the British mandate can be found in many cities of Israel even at present. On November 29, 1947, shortly before the expiration of the mandate (May 14, 1948), the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution No. 181, defining the future administration of Palestine. The resolution provided for the creation of two states in Palestine - Arab and Jewish; the city of Jerusalem remains in trust for the UN. This is what the Russians are talking about, about unfulfilled obligations.  The British have always been provocative in the Middle East , never failed to keep things on fire. On the last day of the crisis resolution, the creation of the independent State of Israel was announced. As a result of the ensuing Arab-Israeli war, an Arab state was not created in Palestine. You are the propaganda but not the press by any means."
 Releasing the hostages would improve the situation for the Palestinians in Gaza. Hamas is used to using hostages for leverage but it clearly is not working this time. Release the hostages so the people in Gaza can get the aid they so desperately need. Israel will not fold due to world pressure and criticism. They believe that they are fighting for the survival of their people and their country. Release the hostages.
 So hypothetical...
 they blamed everyone except themselves
" Both are utterly horrendous, but it's disturbing that a single terrorist attack receives more coverage than over 70 years of ethnic cleansing."
" ""And when the angels said: ""O Mary! Allah has chosen you, created you pure, and favored you over the women of the world."" Blessed Quran"

" The Israelis have suffered thousands of years of oppression, never really having a home until relatively recent times. The Palestinians have suffered recent times oppression and in the long term a compromise must be found for the sake of civilians. Though in present times Hamas have behaved in a fashion that is inhumane and devoid of compassion. They have no place in the future just as the Nazis before them and the Romans before the Nazis."
 Crimes against humanity that‚Äôs rich coming from Hamas
 The missile fire in the heart of the city
 Netanyahu do your best for your country And to protect your people
 We need a van halen concert
 And we thought this was about saving Israeli hostages!! We don‚Äôt know Hamas but we can see genocide.
" The State of Israel has engaged in state-sponsored terrorism, and has been accused of committing acts of state terrorism on a daily basis in the Palestinian Occupied Territories"
 It might be in the Palestinians best interest to alli with Isreal and fight their common enemy - Hamas
 So where exactly are the hamas leaders when they are urging their citizens not to vacate gaza ?
" We should make an effort to label all Israeli and Palestinian conflicts past present and future as the ""Pot and Kettle war"""
 They cheer when sending rockets to Israel but scream when Israel sends them back ..
 There must be proporcionality on Israel's response. It's all I can say.
 The evidence is clear
" UN : he said even war has rules, but Hamas doesn‚Äôt play by the rules of war Mr security general"
" Palestinians' father gives his son the keys of his old house, and Israeli fathers give his son his old foreign passports. That is the end of the story."
 Please read this
 Well they‚Äôre not wrong

 I think all the people condemning Israel should be flown in to fight Hamas with their empathy and compassion. It‚Äôs easy to criticize and much harder to come up with solutions.
 Crazy how none of them blame hamas for attacking and causing the war.
" If you attack a country, expect them to hit back"
" Then Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúPut your sword back into its sheath, for all who take a sword will perish by the sword.‚Äù"
" People really are heartless they‚Äôre literally holding their dead children in their arms and all we can say is ‚Äúyes, but do you condemn Hamas?‚Äù"
 Holy wars are a crime against humanity
" First off, The Gaza Strip is occupied territory of Israel since 1967.  Second, they should repopulate Gaza with Israelis offering free housing.  In the West Bank on the border, Palestinians and Israelis live house by house.  Do the same in Gaza.   Israel also needs a second amendment for the right to bare arms."
" Thank you, Britain, messing these two."
 Hamas must answer and explain to their followers why they (Hamas) created this situation. The terrorists are in hiding and their followers are suffering the consequences.
 The sad reality is this: more than half the population of Gaza is under 18 years old. It seems the blood of the Israeli children killed by Hamas will be repaid by Palestinians 10 times over. And how many new recruits to the various terror groups in Palestine and neighboring nations will this create?  This violence is a cycle that appears to be unending.
" The real question is if Jews can punish Palestinians for crimes they didn't commit, does that give Palestinians the right to punish Jews around the world for crimes they didn't commit also?"
 one wonders whether the wars of hatred continue in heaven.
" Hamas gave Isreal an excuse to go in and reshape Gaza.   Hamas was blinded by Narcissistic leadership and did Isreal a favor (mind you, that is not to dismiss the loss of life.  That was no favor)."
" Stay, who cares, your choice...good luck"
 Prayers on both part
 Most of the injured Palestinians are children and women. This is very sad. Because most of the young men are in the tunnels and use their own wife and kids as a human shield.
" Freedom fighters committing atrocities against the innocent civilians of an unjust occupying state have no ground to stand on. An occupying army justifying their own war crimes by highlighting the atrocities committed by freedom fighters have no ground to stand on either. That being said, armed resistance is certainly morally superior to ‚Äúself defending‚Äù an occupation. An occupier is in no way, shape or form the victim, and historical context cannot be ignored. Shame on those cheering on the strong to annihilate the weak and dispossessed, and shame on those justifying the killing of any civilian."
" ""Theyre cowards. They ve got no humanity.....""bro. Keep trolling and being pushed around by Hamas"
 If Palestinians cannot condemn Hamas for the atrocities they perpetrated then they certainly have no moral standing to condemn Israel
 AND THAT THEY DID HOW CALL?
" i am sorry, cannot do anything from  this corner of the world. it feels pains in my chest near heart by watching father's and mother's crying for their children's. it takes 9 month for women to be mother and whole life for men, to be ""father"". I am sorry i am not there even for just few hands of help. A father carrying their dead children in their arms ""it's the pain which never should be given to any human being by another human.""

 Australia has spoken. Decency has not degraded. Get those Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites over Israel and look for tunnels protruding into Israel.

 Come on the UK government stance is gutless and outwardly siding with the supermarket owners
" Hammas:‚Äù We love death, like you love life.‚Äù"
" What kind of subhuman barbarians would deliberately set children on fire, behead babies, and then run home to hide behind their own children?"
" Here we go "" crime against humanity"" that's funny when you start a war than cry"
" I think we should have a litmus for whether we give a government foreign aid: if they engage in antisemitism or dehumanization of semitic populations, that's a basic disqualifying factor. Considering that Palestinian people are semitic, Israel would be cut off."
 Netanyahu needs wars to remain in power and out of jail for corruption
 Hamas was just throwing a childs birthday party when Isreal attacked.
 May Allah protect our Muslim sisters and brothers
 When we attack we are Muslims and you're infidel. When you counter attack we are humans like you
" ‚ÄúCivilians must never be used as shields.‚Äù - what was the secretary general referring to, does anyone know?"
" You take the horrors inflicted by hamas on Israel and multiply that by 10,000 and it doesn‚Äôt even come close to the horrors the state of Israel has inflicted on the Palestinians since 1947‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm against harming innocent people from whatever side they belong.. but context is important"
 Feel so sorry for all civilians that are suffering from both sides. Netanyahu is not Israel and Hamas is not palestine and it's unfortunate that everybody in the middle is paying the price.
 The situation in Palestine is not complicated at all. There is a strange colonizer and an occupied nation. History will remember this colonialism and how Western governments supported these atrocities in PALESTINE üáµüá∏
" No worries. Gazans will soon be thriving in Chad, Somalia, and Uganda once those countries leaders receive their bribes."
 Gazans should not have danced so much. They did not foresee a long walk coming their way.
 And someone please explain why ppl keep saying Muslims are peaceful but yet have been in the longest and bloodiest war known to man
" Even if hamas gets wiped out, As long as there are Palestinian survivors the cycle of hatred will continue. Both Israel and Palestine can never come to an understanding. It's best for one side to eradicate the other side in order to stop the cycle of war."
" The man complaining that it happened to his grandfather and now to them, DOES HE NOT REALIZE HOW BAD HIS PEOPLE ARE? DOES HE NOT KNOW THAT HAMAS is not FROM ISRAEL, and that HAMAS STARTED THIS WAR???????????? IS THIS MAN COMPLAINING ABOUT LSRAEL? HE needs to open this eyes to the HONEST TRUTH!!!! I fear ALL of Gaza are in on this HAMAS/ISIS  & HEZBOLLA together against the chosen people of God!"
 So when Israel defend itself and fight back after the massacre all of the sudden gaza knows about war crimes. Lol
" Every person standing in, on, or above a valid enemy facility is an active combatant and a collateral victim. Every underground Hamas facility is an active and primary target.  Every structure above ground that has housed Hamas or their equipment is a valid active and primary target. Pretend all one wants, but, all of the Gaza Strip is a COMBAT WAR ZONE. There are 4,000,000 square meters of sand and scrublands along the Mediterranean coastline. These lands will not be bombed or targeted. There is enough room there for every person in Gaza. If one truly desires to live, they will go there. No one needs to be pushed out of Gaza. I would be smart of them to go someplace where they will not be killed."
 That's rich
" Instead of ""do not do to others we would not do to ourselves"", they are doing to others what had been done to ourselves 70 years ago ."

" Hamas is terrible and what they did to Israeli civilians completely horrendous, but Gaza has been under a blockade since 2007 and this created the conditions for Hamas to flourish in the name of safety by Israel with apartheid and land grabs by hardline jewish people from the United States. Clearly the safety argument has been severely disproven. Many are blaming Netyantahu for this inside Israel. Hopefully both sides empathize with civilians but with so much history of oppression it's hard to imagine there will be compassion on either side."

" The Kingdom of Jerusalem, also known as the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem,¬†was a Crusader state!!!"
" What were Palestinians expecting when they voted for Hamas and Hamas executed 1,300 people in cold blood ?  At least Israelis told Palestinians to leave. 1,300 Israelis didn't get this chance. While I feel deeply for the children , for the first time  in my entire life I am having a hard time seeing Palestinians as innocent victims. Also, what did Palestinians do with the billions in aid given to them from various countries?"
 Can someone remind me who voted in Hamas and their policy to destroy Israel?
" What is the reason of Mr.Netanyahu's actions of almost wiping the entire Palestinian population,for some other people's doing?The world knows the history behind everything that's happening in the holy land.The whole Intellectual world should intervene according to reason,not insanity."
 I think it's time Palestine regains control of their own country or they bear responsibility from what happens from it civilians or not
 This news shows how blind the world media is.
" Hamas knows what Israel does. Israelis use LASHAB as urban wars. Hamas knows that Israel Defence Forces have used LASHAB  as urban warfare in Neblus and Jenin in 2002. Having experienced fighting know how from past experience,  Hamas is ready to take the Israeli military in action in Gaza."
 Look how everybody decries Israel's actions while Hamas still holds children hostage. Every person in Gaza is fair game. Cruel but true.
 What do you call an honest Palestinian? Asif.
" They aren't wrong. Israel appeased the world and allowed the Gaza Strip to Secede in 2005 and hold public elections to elect their government. That government was Hamas, Hamas has since then committed war crimes in Gaza. So yes, Israel is responsible for war crimes, war crimes committed against Israel and Gaza by a Government that Israel allowed to exist."
 What you missed is the following:
 As if the Hamas attack was a crime for humanity.

" They took all of their land and gathered them into small areas. They deprived them of the most basic basics of life: water, food, electricity, study and knowledge, freedom and dignity. They deprived some of them of each other. Every day their relatives died. Do you expect them to remain idly waiting for what comes next? What hypocrites you are."
 Palesti...what?????
" Thank you, BBC, for showing a less biased truth. Like head of UN, Guterres said, ""Even under war, there are rules."" In both sides of the borders, there are innocent civilians getting killed and injured. If both sides, key people in power, cannot learn and acknowledge their responsibility and mistakes, and all they care about is revenge and carniage, then you should not be called human beings. The consistent cruelty of the occupation in the last decades has fed the monster of Hamas, but not poison the soul of the innocent civilians in Palestine. They are victims of Israel and Hamas. Can you see the proof in the video footage? a car pack of people with probably 8 squeezed in the trunk and two sitting in the front on top of the hood, and all of them still smiling, ask yourselves why they smile for? Because they, like most civilians in Palestine, have lost EVERYTHING but they are still alive. And what about the ones who are literally walking by foot to keep also their lives? Be brave and call things as they are, this is a Genocide to civilians in Palestine, a Palestinian Holocoust. Key people in Power, use your brain to get rid of Hamas but without innocent blood in your hands."
 UN : War has rules
 Crimes against inhumanity really.
" Palestinians shouldn‚Äôt accuse them for crimes against humanity, they should accuse them for crime against humanity less than us"
 Terror needs the right and appropriate response. Israel has a right to defend itself and Hamas is the instigator of the avalanche of attacks that triggered the rightful response from IDF. Its time Gazans kick out Hamas and fall in line with the previously agreed 2 state solution.
 Release the hostages now and save yourselves!!!
" I pray for the innocent civilians on both Gaza and Israel sides. I am thankful Israel is trying to get the Palestines out to prevent more casualty's. Down with Hamas! Why are the other countries like Egypt, Lebanon, Syria not offering the Palestines a place to go until they can safely be in Gaza?"
 Now they playing victims ?
 Seeing Children makes me so angry an innocent people citizen God Bless Children
 Palestinians are lucky they can pray.
 Palestine has the absolute right to defend itself from terrorism and occupation. Long live the resistance. Justice for the suffered!
" So sad but the Palestinians protesting around the globe, what did they say when hamas started the attack last week?"
 Palentinians authorities or any so called leader must tell that to Hamas before they encroach other backyard and terrorizes and now Palestinians cry for the consequence of their actions.
 And none of them are angry at hamas.
 As expected they attacked they celebrated and now they act as victims when their plans go south.
" This is devastating for these people in Gaza who have already been living in an open air prison. It's also devastating for any US claim to promote democracy and human rights around the world as they help facilitate these horrendous war crimes against men, women, children and yes babies, since the favorite line is about Israeli babies. Actually more babies are being killed in Gaza and have been for years. Carpet bombing Gaza means no victim is spared. I support the cause of the Palestinians and am appalled that the US media and politicians are so biased against them. As the great American civil rights leader Dr. MLK said ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."" That holds true for people living in Gaza or anywhere else. It doesn't matter who the perpetrators are and what religion they claim to practice."

" Gazans should tell Hamas to surrender. If they don‚Äôt, then they themselves are Hamas."
 First Palestinians will take Hamas to the court and then we can consider taking Israel to the court.

" The Palestians accused Israel of crimes against humanity. Never a word never a picture, never a video of what Hamas did in Israel.They did things that even animals wouldn't do to each.other."
" Slaughtering civilians and taking hostages is just another Tuesday for Hamas. Also, firing rockets from civilian homes and using human shields is a crime as well"

 China and the BRICS+ should immediately deploy humanitarian and hospital ships to the Gaza coast while the UN should grow a backbone and send its peacekeepers in regardless of what the the U.S. or the Jewish Army may think to stop the destruction of Gaza.
 They started the war and now there crying?
 Israel needs to be reminded that God also loved Ishmael.
 Hamas claiming to understand humanity is a joke.
" Before crying for the love one killed and accusing anyone they should know who first started the war and fired the rocket first. There is a saying "" Don't wake a sleeping lion"""
" Palestine will learn lesson ,they will never forget. Palestinian have lost any sympathy nor empathy from the rest of non Arab countries."
" Look I mean I‚Äôm with Israel on this one but I‚Äôm also an anti war person, I don‚Äôt agree with what Israel is doing to innocent people and I don‚Äôt agree with what Gaza is doing to innocent people. If it were up to me I would say the people of Gaza should go back to Egypt, the lands which they came from in attempts to occupy the lands and rid the world of Jews. For that reason I‚Äôm on Israel‚Äôs side but it‚Äôs a tough call as to the morality of both sides actions"
 Maybe they will use (gas) next.
" Isreal should never allow terrorists to destroy their lives, families, people. Isreal has been persecuted and suffered more than ANY RACE, COLOR, or Creed. Even black people in America has nevered suffered like Isreal."
 Deep down..Its the religion (the culprit)from bothe sides....
 dont forget how they all dance and celebrate when their leaders commit atrocities but when its their turn to suffer they have no shame and blame it on the other side and dont dare to blame their leaders for that.
" ""If you're not careful, the newspapers (media) will have you hating the people who are being oppressed, and loving the people who are doing the oppressing."""
 The Palestinians peoples hearts and souls have been so hardened by the atrocities over decades. Anywhere else in the world and a father would be so devastated by the loss of his child. That man has the strength to carry his child despite I'm sure his heart being broken. You can't expect peace if you do this to people. You simply can't go through civilians to get to Hamas. Israel are being too aggressive and inhumane.

" The fundamental problem is and always has been some form of ideology, in this case being religion. The path to peace is to shed ones need to identify with some ideology. Unless that happens tragedies like these will continue to happen. Although it is in human nature to behave this way as it is an inherent survival instinct, one need to 'educate' themselves to see the reality beyond such meaningless identifications. The true reality is we are neither jews, muslims, arabs, europeans etc, etc but instead share a common purpose of survival and the same ultimate fate of death."
" Why are people infantilising the people of Gaza ? They were all singing and dancing a week ago now they want humanity?  Where is Hamas' humanity? They're still shelling Israel and what Israel is supposed to take their repeated attacks laying down? Palestinians voted Hamas in and they've gotten what they voted for.  Why are they expecting Israel to follow the rules of war, but Hamas can go around starting fights and running away. If the people of Gaza want this to end they should give up Hamas and give the hostages back.  They should also ask Hamas what happened to all the aid they were given and their water pipes."
 Hamas is not strong enough to stand up to 2 million of there own citizens. Best way for this to end is for Palestinians to resist Hamas. If they don‚Äôt they‚Äôre complicit. Don‚Äôt blame Israel for these children‚Äôs death blame their fathers.
 Humanity .. ?? .. Forgive me for saying this but who struck innocent women and children first .. Not just here .. Its every where now .. The world is becoming a dark place ..
" If you are only just learning about this conflict, I would suggest to not pick a side based on only superficial media information. Palestine have every right to defend themselves, Israelis torment the citizens of Palestine everyday. This torment is considered too normal to make it into the news, but as soon as Palestine retaliate then the world starts siding with Israel."
 Lol look who‚Äôs accusing someone for crime to humanity
 Its funny that the guilty complains first.....
 How dare Palestinians accuse Israel of crimes against humanity without denouncing Hamas.

" Israel should follow ""Mahatma"" Gandhi's principle of ""non-violence"" and  do nothing but surrender to Hamas and let themselves be wiped out by them so that  ""one day"" Hamas realizes their mistake. This was the preaching of ""Mahatma"" Gandhi to the Hindus in India who were being attacked by the mullas during the widespread riot that broke out between the two communites in the pre-independence era of the country.

What is the meaning of Security Council resolutions that Israel did not implement?  What is the meaning of international neglect?  What is the meaning of double standards, and what is the meaning of resistance and struggle for independence? For 75 years, the Palestinians have been suffering under an unjust occupation that kills innocents, women and children, arrests them, demolishes their homes, and bulldozes their lands. Hamas did not exist at that time. The peg on which you hang Israel‚Äôs crimes had not yet been created. The curtain had not been created.  The way you manage your racism exists...so where was your alleged humanity...."

 Hamas are claiming swap prisoners so simple.
 No mercy on terrorists using civilians as shield. Palestinians only see the evil Israeli soldiers unleashed on them ignoring the evil Hamas first unleashed on Israeli civilians and IDF. I stand with Israel.

" Terrorists or freedom fighters, the Israeli regime with its Victim Complex would have you believe they are terrorists, however the facts of the last decades if studied might bring you to the conclusion that freedom fighters would be more accurate. People oppressed by an apartheid regime will and do fight back knowing the repercussions will far outweigh their actions, but they do it anyway, to make a stand, to show contempt for their oppressor, this is exactly what is happening right now. I do not condone the use of violence, Israel‚Äôs response to the Palestinian attack last weekend was always going to be totally disproportionate and now we are looking at the Internationally condoned ethnic cleansing of Palestine, still just within living memory of the Holocaust."
 The sides aren't morally equivalent.

" What should we do now? For the civilized world, civilians ""MUST"" be evacuated for the duration of hostilities (including disabled men of the age of capacity for warfare). I think the UN should evacuate to large islands in the sea, of course take care of humanity. Some men have to be evacuated even though they are Palestinian, they are, let's say, 25 years old, but they cannot take part in the war, they are disabled, for example, they have no leg, no arm, or they can't see much, it makes no sense!!! War, even the inevitable one, must be humanitarian. This must be ensured first if there is to be normality, despite strong emotions. The US armed forces selected approximately 2,000. soldiers and prepare them to be sent to support Israel. I'm just begging you, Americans, I know you only want good and help, okay, that's fine, but as always, only good things will come out, and it will come out when they do... :( I'll give you some good advice, Americans, help the Israeli soldiers, but under cover, as a whole Israeli troops, which means American soldiers should be in Israeli uniforms, cars with Israeli army markings.

 Dont you think its too obvious that Israel is committing war crimes against entire Palestinians? In every conflict BBC was able to quickly identify but only when it comes to Palestine it becomes very hard for BBC to see israli war crimes.
 Are they ever stop hamas not to sent 6000 rocket bomb to israel? Nope they are cheering when hamas did it..
 Everyone should stand againts hammas even the arab countries because they are putting millions of their own in danger.
 they should also blamed Hamas
 Geee I wonder what pissed off Israel so much
 Like calling the kettle black
 i really find it strange how the world support israel while committing such bad act
" They all blame israel with complete disregard that isreals very people, without any distinction between military or civilians were the first to be bombarded killed and taken hostage by their leaders, oppressors or whatever the relationship between hamas and the general palestinian population is. At least israel gave everyone a chance to flee before retaliating. You can't say the same for the surprise attack by hamas. The paleatinians voted or accepted hamas as far as it is told. So when everything is fine it's not an issue but as soon as israel responds to hamas actions they are all ready to blame and cry about israel instead of hamas which they have been accepting, supporting or tolerating over the years."
 Does the BBC and British state not accuse Israel of war crimes? Do they find the IDF innocent?
 There is no FIXING what HAMAs has become

 Hahaha man the Palestinian people can tell a good joke
 The west have a long memory for the outrages by Hamas. The West Remembers
 It‚Äôs farcical that the Palestinians are accusing Isreal of atrocities after Hamas slaughtered innocent people at a music festival & again killed hundreds in a local kabutz!
 Maybe   the Palestinians  are  correct  but what is  their  take on Hamas or Hezbollah ?
" understand that every Muslim will not tolerate attacks on their prophet, religion, mosque, and fellow believers."
 Stop attacks on innocent people especially children.
 STOP KILLING  THE INNOCENTS!!
 Thats the pot calling the kettle blavk
 How does Israel know that Palestinians remain in Gaza are not part of Hamas?
 ATM Hamas (a terrorist organisation) is fighting Israel army but it's the unfortunate Palestinian children that are dying
 This is Hamas doing!!!
" It‚Äôs official, the kettle is black."
 Pot calling the Kettle Black.
 Why don‚Äôt they hate Hamas?

" That's what you get, if you support or tolerate a fanatic and terrorist government. My grandmother had to learn that, too."
 Ohhhhhh Boo-Hoo
" That's what you get, if you support or tolerate a fanatic and terrorist government. My grandmother had to learn that, too."
 Ohhhhhh Boo-Hoo
" They didn't say that when Hamas slaughtered, beheaded, and barbecued women, children, elderly in Israel. These are Gazans' crocodile tears."
" Soldiers, terrorists, politicians, Jews, Palestinians, everyone, please return to the home of love. With my beloved family and loved ones..."
 which humanity?
 Well you probably shouldnt have kicked that hornets nest eh?
 600 CHILDREN
 LOL! Terrorist talking about humanity!

" The hypocrispy of these clowns in the comments, how can a victim cut out an oppressors food, water, and electricity?"
 Hypocrisy why did Hamas attack why start this
" Sure the babies would say the same thing, if only hamas let them keep their heads."
 Why? Then this world will respond to that???
" Once a muslim always a Muslim. If you don't think so, ask ""The Squad"" in the US Congress."
 free Palestinians   no no
" The Palestinian People should direct alot of their anger towards Hamas. I assume that they know why they're being bombed in the 1st place? And did any of these innocent civilians denounce or feel remorse for the atrocities  and butchering of innocent children, women and elderly in Israel?"
 ‚Äúcrimes against humanity‚Äù - what about that shit they pulled last week? These idiots were dancing on the streets. Lol
 People who have humanity don't dance and celebrate in the street when civilians are murdered.
 LONG LIVE PALESTINE
 Stop killing
 Here we go the VICTIM CARD.
 Just like Russia and Poo tin?
" There you go, the rapist accusing the victim of the crime."
 war is war in the end all that is important is who remains. that is why as much as possible we should all avoid war.

 Mosque Al Aqsa is a place which God Almighty Allah  like most .. a place where Holly Prophet Mohammed pbuh lead the prayer and rest of all the Prophets of Allah Almighty include Prophet  Jesus pbuh and Prophet Moses pbuh  stood behind Prophet Mohammed pbuh on the way of journey of Miraaj.. one of the greatest miracle of Almighty Allah . Mentioned clearly at the beginning of 15th chapter in Quran

" Why wont hamas hand over hostages, for food and water"
 As per Mahabharata even wars should have rules and ethics.
 palistine doesn't know the rules of war or just denying it.
 They've got a nerve
 Where is Palestine in map
 Terrible all civilians that died on both sides
 That‚Äôs like Russia accusing Ukraine of ‚Äúcrimes against humanity‚Äù
 Boohoo you started
 Russia and Israel both want land
 Crimes against humanity? Well they should know.....
 The war has rule but at war nobody obey it.
 Gaza should not have harbored terrorists.  Too damn bad.
" Having brazenly committed reprehensible crimes against Israelis, they have no right to make any such allegation."
" innocent weeping child of Ghaza are suffering from hunger, water, shelter , world has closed eyes, stop brutal in Ghaza,  Muslim worlds be practical inspite of giving statements,  plz save innocent human from brutality of Isril, what will you response to your God about this"
" I mean, butchering babies is also a crime against humanity‚Ä¶."
 I can't imagine my family being taken from there beds . My kids executed in front off me. My wife then sexually assaulted then executed. If you go punch someone in the face expect a harder punch back.
 Oh dear! Have you forgotten what you did a few days ago Palistine? Of course Hamas tell you to ignore the order to move. If you do it means they will lose their human shield...YOU!

 Maybe Palestinians should place the blame where it actually lies.  But then they couldn‚Äôt dance in the street when hamas attacks somebody.  Oh no.
 you cant attack a people and then cry when they fight back
 Support Israel
" Oh God please save innocient people in Gaza,city"
 I accuse hamas os crimes against humanity
" Stop talking about humanity, the day hamas attacked israel is the day the humanity has left both side. Now there  is only brutality , its a hamas or israel. So the winner of this war is clear even before it started."
" ""our enemy is evil, they have no humanity"" he says, after his government, he ellected decapitated babies with shovels."
" Song: Alway puut d blames, on d jews!!"
 Palestinians need to learn to love their children more than they hate the Israelis.
" ""wars have rules."" That doesnt mean shit to Hamas, and since they want to destroy Israel, Israel has zero fucks to give about wars having rules....."

 It all started with crimes against humanity on 7th oktober
 Apartheid State definition: a state that is separated by race.
 taqiyya
 Actions have consequences
 People of Gaza should stand up against Hamas. They aren't evil and are suffering the most. Hamas has to be rotted out.

 Crazy thing when they're the one it begin
 What is is that the Palestinians have done then? They started this Israel Will finish it.
 Dont poke a sleeping bear
 This was my home land Palestine is my Homeland
" STRANGE,‚Ä¶I THOUGHT EGYPT WAS A MUSLIM COUNTRY, ..SO MUCH FOR ‚Äú BROTHERHOOD ‚Äú"
" And the worst part is that Israel was told about this 'surprise attack' in advance, as you would have expected."
 So there's no more Palestinian country ?
" Blah, blah.  Don‚Äôt start what you can‚Äôt finish."
 Crimes humanity you said? How about the innocent people was killed  by Hamas? Was that not included in humanity you‚Äôre talking about?
 and u can telll the difference between hamas and regular civilian????????? WAT U GOT A ID CARD SAYING IM HAMAS LMFAOO all these scammer from isreal!!
 I'm sorry? Accuse them of crimes? Who shot missles first into Isreal. That was the crime. I don't want any innocent Palestinians hurt but you can't blame Isreal for this.
 Why have they stopped their celebrations
 So we're supposed to feel sorry for these Muslims?

 This playbook is so obvious to predict. Humans will be the same forever. It's quite obvious these issues will persist indefinitely. Sad but true.
 Its their fault.. they let hamas ruled over them.. now they have to live with it.. i feel sorry for the palestinian civilians..
 Palestinians you are wrong!! Hamas is the one who is doing that!!
 And what about Hamas??fallen angels..
" Well, unfortunately the whole world watched the actual crime against humanity, so please don't be offended that your cries of victimhood are met with deaf ears."
 We support Israel
" When you'r drunk vomiting at the restaurant table,and you accuse the sommelier of being an alcoholic"
 Why no gleeful dancing?   You were more than ecstatic when you heard that innocent babies and girls were being raped and murdered‚Ä¶
" Palestinians should leave their land and home for now. What's the sense of staying in a land being constantly bombarded. They will still have at least a chance to come back once war is over. But if they die, they can't go back to their land, moreso come back from afterlife. They should choose survival for now."
 My sympathies are very limited toward those who refuse to move to safety.
" Why are the muslims not shouting Hamas to stop the firing? Instead of asking Iran, Libanon to attack Israel. They want Israel gone with force but Israel should not fight back?"
 In the video you saw rockets being shot from residental building. This is exactly the strategy of Hamas - targeting civilians and hiding behind civilians. What would YOU do?
" ""war has rules"""
" People want their borders back.,"
" To say that Israel has no conscience is ridicilous! Hamas slaughtered, with no warning, innocent children, Israel is giving civilians a chance to leave before attacking. War is ugly, but propraganda makes it worse."

 They had it coming .One cannot expect to receive flowers when you sent 7000 plus rockets
 Free Palestine !!!!!
 It happened to your fathers because they were just as sorry as you are. 70% of Gazans chose Hamas to lead them. This means by and large these people have given comfort and support to these terrorists. You reap what you sow.
 Bit ironic
" Hamas what have you done, Palestinians have no water or food or each other"
 Where are the israelis in the comment section? Explain yourselves.
 Why aren't you interviewing Hamas? We want to hear why they don't have enough morgue space or hospital resources. Why didn't Hamas prepare doctors for this? Why isn't Hamas providing an armed corridor for safety? Why isn't Hamas providing food and shelter? Why isn't Hamas having engineers restore the power? Why wasn't Hamas preparing people?
 oh what did I hear Palestianian dont like war ? hhmmm o so You wanne have peace ooh cute hmmm maybe you should't be so hatefull hmm
" Never forget the 1,300 innocent Israelis, including children, slaughterd by Hamas, that got us into this mass."
 Peaceful community spreading peace
 Hammas why attacked Jews people ?
 So HAmAs beheading babies is not a crime against humanity?
 Crazy have we learnt nothing
 there's no innocent in Palestine ..
 What hamas did to Israeli children and women? Karma!!
 Because you are repeating the past ....
 Maybe if you people stopped Hamas from shooting rockets from your rooftops and hiding underneath you wouldn't be taking Israels wrath at this time.

" How dare these terrorists talk about ""Humanity"" after massacring the innocent people in the most brutal way an animal would not even dare do while celebrating  towards the massacre."
" 2 wrongs don't make a right. I don't care how Israel justifies it, they still have Palestinian blood on their hands. IDF are not better than Hamas at this point."
 Why was the bbc silent when Kashmiri Muslims send Kashmiri Hindus packing./ u are no one to speak / just be silent like before
 Full support to Israel from Finland!

 How hard is it to release hostages? Blame Hamas not Israel!
 Ham-ass it the culprit the innocent people of Gaza should help Israel defeat them
 they should become one country. a nation state has different religions and ethnics which is very normal and natural.
 All you false news spreding false propaganda have blood on your hands. You‚Äôll be asked for it one day trust me.
 Glad to see how people in this comment act like Nazis while supporting Jews. So ironic
 To everyone who is saying hamas is not letting them escape its not that its because Israel has bombed the border of Egypt so theres no escape for Palestinians may the people who have perished rest in peace and go straight tp heaven
" Well, maybe think about children before decide to elect a war prone terror group. Don't use children for propaganda purpose. I feel sorry for the children, but that's mostly their parents fault."
 Free Palestinian
 They attacked 1st now they have to pay price
" propaganda video from the BBC, didn't expect anything else"
 Palestinian independence and ending the Palestinian genocide
 What about Palestinian HAMAS kill Ezrael people?
" Palestenians attacks israel , then when israel backfires , palestianians cries help"
" Britain, please welcome your new Palestinian refugee neighbors"
" not a mention of that water, electricity, food are cut off"
 Bbc love hamas and want Palestinians to move to UK.
